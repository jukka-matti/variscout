# Canvas Wall Overlay

> **PR8 sub-PR 8e — focused extension of the not-yet-written Spec 4 (canvas overlays + Wall sync).** Closes the unmet vision-spec commitment surfaced by the canvas PR4c–PR6 retrospective (2026-05-06): _"Canvas Wall overlay is badge projection, not 'same data, two views' mirror (vision §5.6)."_
>
> **Scope:** the V1 read-only Wall overlay layer that mounts inside the canvas — its visibility rules, its viewport sharing model, its layering against the 8d hypothesis-tool, its empty-state and mobile fallback. Does NOT redesign the Wall destination view (`WallCanvas` shipped via Phase 13/14), does NOT introduce write affordances in the overlay (DnD, ⌘K palette, hub-comment SSE) — those are deferred to a future sub-PR.

## 1. Context

### Why this spec exists

Vision §5.6 commits:

> _"The Wall is **dual-home**: it remains the canonical destination in the Investigation tab AND becomes one of the canvas overlays (§5.4). Same data, two views."_

And §5.4 reinforces:

> _"With overlays off, the canvas is a clean live map. With overlays on, the canvas IS the Wall view (see §5.6 — dual-home)."_

PR6 shipped a lighter projection of investigation context onto the canvas: per-step badge counts and linked-item lists rendered inside `CanvasStepCard`, driven by `useCanvasInvestigationOverlays` for the four overlay types (`'investigations' | 'hypotheses' | 'suspected-causes' | 'findings'`). Defensible V1 — but not the dual-home Wall mirror §5.6 commits to. The retrospective surfaced this gap; the master plan ([`2026-05-07-canvas-pr8-vision-alignment-master.md`](../plans/2026-05-07-canvas-pr8-vision-alignment-master.md) §4) lists the Wall mirror as PR8 sub-PR 8e and called for a brainstorm to pick the architectural fork.

The 2026-05-08 brainstorm picked **Fork 1 — embed `WallCanvas` viewport in canvas as the overlay layer**, honoring §5.6 verbatim per `feedback_honor_vision_commitments`. The hybrid expand-to-modal and status-quo+amend-spec forks were rejected as hedges that demote the vision.

### What this spec decides

1. The overlay is a **read-only Wall mirror** in V1; click-to-drill navigates to the Investigation tab destination view; mutating affordances (DnD, ⌘K, hub-comment SSE, hypothesis card reorder) stay in the destination view only.
2. The Wall overlay toggle is **hidden** from `CanvasOverlayPicker` until the investigation graph contains ≥1 hub / question / finding.
3. The overlay shares the **same `useWallLayoutStore` viewport** (zoom / pan / groupByTributary) as the destination view — pan/zoom in either surface mirrors live.
4. Input layering when both overlay and 8d's draw-hypothesis tool are active: **canvas (back) → Wall layer (mid, `pointer-events: none`) → hypothesis-tool gesture handler (top)**. Overlay regains pointer events for click-to-drill once the tool deactivates.
5. The overlay-active toggle (`'wall'` ∈ `activeCanvasOverlays`) is **View** layer per F4 — symmetric with the four existing overlays.
6. **Mobile fallback** (<768px): the toggle slot in the canvas toolbar re-skins to a "Open Wall ↗" navigation button that deep-links to the Investigation tab → Wall sub-tab. The View-store value is tolerated either way; render gates on `useWallIsMobile()`.

### What this spec does NOT decide

- Write affordances inside the overlay (drag-drop hub→gate, hypothesis card reorder, ⌘K palette, hub-comment SSE) — deferred to a future sub-PR.
- The canvas viewport architecture (multi-canvas / zoom semantics across multiple overlays) — that is 8f's separate spec.
- Retroactive documentation of the existing PR6 read-side overlay projections (the four pre-existing `CanvasOverlayId` values) — Tier 3 retrospective followup.
- Animation polish for overlay mount/unmount transitions — defer to followup if visual review surfaces a need.
- Methodology integration for the Wall (when does an investigator pick Wall vs Evidence Map vs Question framework?) — separate doc tracked in `docs/decision-log.md`.

## 2. Scope

The 8e implementation includes:

- A new `'wall'` value on the `CanvasOverlayId` union plus updates to `CANVAS_OVERLAY_REGISTRY`, `coerceCanvasOverlays`, `useSessionCanvasFilters` consumers.
- A new `<CanvasWallOverlay/>` internal component in `packages/ui/src/components/Canvas/internal/` that renders the overlay layer.
- A new `mode?: 'destination' | 'overlay'` prop on `WallCanvas` (default `'destination'`) that gates the read-only behavior set inside the existing component.
- A predicate (selector or hook) `useHasInvestigationContent()` returning `true` iff hubs ∪ questions ∪ findings ≠ ∅; `CanvasOverlayPicker` filters out `'wall'` when `false`.
- A mobile re-skin of the `'wall'` toolbar slot to a `WallShortcutButton` that calls a new `onOpenWall` prop (PWA + Azure wire to `setInvestigationViewMode('wall')` + `setWallViewMode('wall')`).
- Tests for overlay rendering, click-to-drill, layer-boundary, 8d compatibility, and resize behavior.

The 8e implementation does NOT include:

- Any change to `WallCanvas`'s destination-view behavior (the existing `'destination'` mode is the default and unchanged).
- Any persistent state additions (`STORE_LAYER` and `layerBoundary.test.ts` unchanged).
- Any change to PR6's existing per-step badge overlays (the four pre-existing `CanvasOverlayId` values render unchanged when `'wall'` is also active).

## 3. Decision Q1 — V1 scope: read-only Wall mirror with click-to-drill

### Rule

V1 overlay renders `WallCanvas` with `mode='overlay'`, which:

- Skips `DndContext` mount (no hub→gate drag, no hypothesis card reorder).
- Skips `useWallHubCommentLifecycle()` SSE subscription.
- Skips ⌘K command palette subscription (the overlay is not a navigation root).
- Renders `HypothesisCard` in place of `DraggableHypothesisCard`.
- Suppresses the `MissingEvidenceDigest` HTML panel (overlay shows SVG only — keeps the layered footprint clean).
- Keeps click handlers (`onSelectHub`, `onPromoteQuestion`, `onPromoteFromQuestion`, `onSeedFromFactorIntel`, `onFocusHubFromGap`) live, but the app wires them to a single `onDrillToHub(id)` / `onDrillToQuestion(id)` / `onDrillToFinding(id)` family that:
  1. Sets `panelsStore.investigationViewMode = 'wall'`.
  2. Sets `wallLayoutStore.viewMode = 'wall'`.
  3. Calls the destination-view's existing pan-to-node helper for the entity's anchor.

### Why

§5.6's "two views, same data" frames the destination as the deep-work surface; the overlay is the cadence-loop scan. Mutating from the scan surface dilutes that split — the user goes deep when they need to mutate, glances when they're scanning. Read-only with drill clicks honors the split and keeps V1 scope tight (~6 tasks per master-plan estimate).

Pure spectator (no clicks at all) was rejected: the cadence-loop UX requires a drill-in path, and click-to-navigate is the lightest addition that supports it.

V1 write-capable was rejected: would balloon scope past the master-plan upper bound and conflate the read-only/write split that V2 should make deliberate.

### Implementation notes

- `WallCanvas` already accepts all click handlers as props with no internal mutation — the read-only `mode='overlay'` is a pure subtraction of subscriptions and DnD wrapping, not a behavior fork inside the SVG render.
- `mode='overlay'` defaults stay safe: when omitted, the existing destination-view behavior is unchanged. No callsite migration in the destination view.
- The drill helpers can live in app-layer (PWA `InvestigationView` and Azure `InvestigationWorkspace`) or a shared selector hook in `@variscout/hooks` if the assembly is identical. Decided at plan time; not a spec-level commitment.

## 4. Decision Q2 — Empty-state handling: hidden until ≥1 entity exists

### Rule

`CanvasOverlayPicker` filters `'wall'` out of its rendered toggle list when `useHasInvestigationContent()` returns `false`. Other overlays (`'investigations' | 'hypotheses' | 'suspected-causes' | 'findings'`) are unaffected — they continue to render in the picker regardless of content emptiness, projecting no-ops on canvas step cards as today.

### Why

Per `feedback_hidden_vs_disabled_cta`: hide unwired CTAs entirely; reserve disabled for unmet prerequisites with concrete copy. The Wall overlay genuinely has no surface to show on an empty graph — the existing `EmptyState` component lives in `WallCanvas` and is designed for the destination-view full-frame context, not a glance overlay over a populated canvas.

The pre-existing four overlays don't follow this rule because they project per-step badges that intrinsically render as zeros — no false affordance, no jarring empty surface. The Wall is structurally different: rendering an EmptyState component as an overlay over a populated canvas would be visually noisy and pedagogically misleading.

### Implementation notes

- `useHasInvestigationContent()` derives from existing stores: `useInvestigationStore.suspectedCauses`, `.questions`, `useFindingsStore.findings` — purely a selector, no new state.
- `CanvasOverlayPicker` accepts a new `availableOverlays?: CanvasOverlayId[]` prop (defaulting to all five for back-compat with non-mounting consumers); the canvas index passes `availableOverlays = hasContent ? allFive : fourWithoutWall`.
- The toggle reappears immediately when content is added (subscriber-level reactivity, no debounce).

## 5. Decision Q3 — Viewport sharing: shared `useWallLayoutStore`

### Rule

The overlay reads and writes the same `useWallLayoutStore.zoom`, `.pan`, `.groupByTributary` as the destination view. Pan/zoom gestures inside the overlay surface mutate the store; pan/zoom in the destination view propagates to the overlay. The overlay's outer `<div>` clips its rendered SVG to the canvas viewport bounds and provides independent scroll _only when the SVG exceeds the overlay viewport at current zoom_ (i.e., overflow is local, but the underlying viewport-state is shared).

### Why

§5.6's "same data, two views" extends naturally to view-state. A user scanning the overlay finds an interesting region, opens the destination view (Investigation tab), and lands at the same zoom/pan they were studying — no orientation lost. Conversely, a user finishing deep work in the destination view and returning to the canvas finds the overlay positioned at the last-studied region.

Independent ephemeral viewport was rejected: it forces a re-orientation cost on every cross-surface jump and breaks the symmetry §5.6 commits to. Fixed fit-to-canvas was rejected: dense Walls (>10 hubs, with sub-step grouping) need the cadence-scan affordance of pan/zoom — fitting the entire Wall into the canvas viewport at all times collapses to a thumbnail with no scan affordance.

### Implementation notes

- `WallCanvas` already reads zoom/pan/groupByTributary as props from `useWallLayoutStore` selectors at the destination-view callsite; the overlay does the same. No change to `WallCanvas`'s prop API for viewport.
- `useWallLayoutStore` is annotation per-project (existing) — survives reload across sessions for the same hub. Per F4 boundary, that's correct: the user's last studied viewport is project-scoped state, not a session-only view.
- Performance: `WallCanvas` SVG renders at fixed 2000×1400 viewBox; viewport zoom is a CSS transform on a wrapping `<g>`. Layered render cost is linear in hubs/questions/findings count. The 768px viewport guard (Q6) prevents the overlay from rendering at all on mobile, where DOM cost would matter most.

## 6. Decision Q4 — Input layering: canvas → Wall → hypothesis-tool

### Rule

Z-stack on the canvas surface (bottom → top):

1. Canvas step cards + lens-rendered annotations (existing).
2. Per-step badge overlays (existing four `CanvasOverlayId` types).
3. **Wall overlay layer** (`<CanvasWallOverlay/>`) — when `'wall'` ∈ `activeCanvasOverlays` AND `!isMobile` AND content exists. Z-index above per-step badges, below tool gesture handler.
4. Active-tool gesture handler — when `activeCanvasTool === 'draw-hypothesis'`, an invisible top-layer captures pointer events for the 8d arrow-drawing gesture.

When the hypothesis tool is active, the Wall overlay layer's outer wrapper sets `pointer-events: none`. This passes pointer events through to canvas step cards underneath, so the 8d gesture commits between cards rather than being intercepted by hub cards. After tool deactivates (mode-1, the default), the wrapper removes the `pointer-events: none`, and the Wall layer regains normal pointer events for click-to-drill.

### Why

`feedback_check_shipped_patterns_first`: 8d Spec 4 §6 already establishes "tool active → overlay auto-enables, gesture handler is top layer" as the input-layering precedent. Extending that precedent — Wall overlay sits above per-step badges but below the gesture handler — keeps the canvas tool-mode model coherent. The Wall is _content_ in the overlay sense; the hypothesis tool is _input modality_ in a higher sense.

The alternative (Wall always wins pointer events when visible) would break 8d's combined flow: a user with the Wall overlay on, who then activates the draw-hypothesis tool, expects to draw arrows between canvas step cards, not hub cards. Forcing them to dismiss the Wall first kills the cadence-scan-to-author micro-loop §5.4 implicitly enables.

The mutual-exclusion option (one-or-the-other) was rejected because the cadence-scan + draw-hypothesis flow is a real and valuable combined pattern: the user spots a missing hypothesis while scanning the Wall, activates the draw tool, draws the arrow without dismissing context.

### Implementation notes

- `<CanvasWallOverlay/>`'s outer wrapper computes `pointerEventsClass = activeCanvasTool === 'draw-hypothesis' ? 'pointer-events-none' : ''`. Single Tailwind class swap; no JS event-routing logic.
- 8d's `useHypothesisDrawTool` already establishes the top-layer pattern — the Wall overlay just respects the same `activeCanvasTool` selector.
- Click-to-drill handlers on hub cards inside the overlay receive pointer events normally when the tool is in `'select'` mode, since the wrapper is interactive.

## 7. Decision Q5 — F4 layer assignments

| State surface                            | F4 layer   | Concrete home                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `'wall'` ∈ `activeCanvasOverlays`        | View       | Existing `useSessionCanvasFilters`. Symmetric with the four existing overlays.                              |
| `useWallLayoutStore.zoom/pan/groupBy…`   | Annotation | Existing `useWallLayoutStore` (annotation per-project). Reused by both destination and overlay surfaces.    |
| Active canvas tool (8d, ride-along only) | View       | Already specified in 8d Spec 4 §9; unchanged here.                                                          |
| Drill destination (transient)            | n/a        | Action call into `usePanelsStore.setInvestigationViewMode` + `useWallLayoutStore.setViewMode` + pan helper. |

### F4 D4 boundary test impact

No new stores. No changes to `STORE_LAYER` constants in `@variscout/core`. `layerBoundary.test.ts` adds an assertion that `'wall'` ∈ `useSessionCanvasFilters.activeCanvasOverlays` is View-layer (parallel to the existing four-overlay assertion).

### Why View, not Annotation per-user

Per the brainstorm: `usePreferencesStore` would persist Wall-overlay-on across reloads, which makes the lone outlier of the five overlays asymmetric. Promoting all five to per-user persistence is scope creep into other overlays. Cadence-loop UX matches the View pattern: every reload starts with a clean canvas; user opts into overlays per session. If user research surfaces a power-user demand for persistent overlay state, that's a deliberate cross-cutting refactor of all five overlay toggles, not a 8e decision.

## 8. Decision Q6 — Mobile fallback: viewport-adaptive toggle semantics

### Rule

The `'wall'` slot in the canvas toolbar adapts by viewport:

- **Desktop (≥768px)**: rendered as a normal `CanvasOverlayPicker` toggle. Click toggles `'wall'` ∈ `activeCanvasOverlays`. Overlay mounts when toggle on AND content exists.
- **Mobile (<768px)**: rendered as a `WallShortcutButton` with external-link glyph and label "Open Wall". Click invokes a new `onOpenWall` prop the app provides; PWA + Azure wire it to navigate to Investigation tab → Wall sub-tab. The View-store `activeCanvasOverlays` is not mutated by this gesture on mobile.
- **Cross-breakpoint resize**: the View store can hold `'wall'` in either viewport; render gates on `useWallIsMobile()`. On a desktop-→mobile resize while overlay active, the overlay un-mounts; the toggle slot re-skins to `WallShortcutButton`. On mobile→desktop resize, if the View store still has `'wall'`, the overlay re-mounts; otherwise the toggle is in its off state.
- **Empty-content interplay**: on mobile, the slot is hidden when content is empty (same predicate as desktop), since the destination view's mobile path also has nothing to show.

### Why

Layered overlays are a desktop-canvas affordance. On mobile, layers stop being layers and become navigable views — same data, sequential access. This is the canonical pattern across Miro / FigJam / Mural / Figma mobile / Power Apps responsive design. Forcing layers onto small screens (the "always-embedded with MobileCardList in overlay" alternative) creates the textbook anti-pattern: full-bleed list overlay buries the canvas; both compete for the same pixels.

§5.6's two-views-same-data framing is _especially_ clean here: the Wall destination view IS the mobile manifestation of the Wall data (`MobileCardList` already swaps in below 768px in destination mode). So the toggle on mobile = navigate-to-destination is not a workaround — it's the dual-home architecture revealing itself device-appropriately. Single mental model ("show me the Wall data"), device-appropriate manifestation.

The "hide toggle on mobile" alternative was rejected: it silently denies mobile users the affordance, and they never learn the Wall is reachable from canvas. The viewport-adaptive re-skin teaches the affordance and points to the right mobile path.

### Implementation notes

- `useWallIsMobile()` already exists in `packages/charts/src/InvestigationWall/hooks/useWallBreakpoint.ts` and exports `WALL_MOBILE_BREAKPOINT = 768` — the canvas toolbar re-skin uses the same hook (or the equivalent `useIsMobile` from `@variscout/ui`, which shares the `BREAKPOINTS.mobile = 768` constant).
- `WallShortcutButton` is a new `packages/ui/src/components/Canvas/internal/` component, ~30 LOC. External-link icon (existing icon set), label, click handler. Follows existing toolbar button styling.
- The `onOpenWall` prop is a new top-level `<Canvas/>` prop (per `packages/ui/src/components/Canvas/index.tsx`); PWA `MapView` and Azure `WorkspaceView` wire it as a sibling to the existing `onLensChange` / `onOverlayToggle` props.
- The drill destination on mobile is the same as the desktop drill: Investigation tab → Wall sub-tab → entity selected if applicable. On `WallShortcutButton`, no entity is in scope yet, so the navigation lands on the Wall view at its current viewport.

```

### Files

**New files**:

- `packages/ui/src/components/Canvas/internal/CanvasWallOverlay.tsx` — overlay wrapper component.
- `packages/ui/src/components/Canvas/internal/WallShortcutButton.tsx` — mobile re-skin button.
- `packages/ui/src/components/Canvas/__tests__/CanvasWallOverlay.test.tsx` — overlay behavior tests.

**Modified files**:

- `packages/hooks/src/useCanvasInvestigationOverlays.ts` — add `'wall'` to `CanvasOverlayId`, `CANVAS_OVERLAY_REGISTRY`, `coerceCanvasOverlays`.
- `packages/hooks/src/useSessionCanvasFilters.ts` — accommodate the new value (mostly type-level).
- `packages/hooks/src/__tests__/useCanvasInvestigationOverlays.test.ts` — assert `'wall'` round-trips through coercion + registry.
- `packages/charts/src/InvestigationWall/WallCanvas.tsx` — add `mode?: 'destination' | 'overlay'` prop; gate `DndContext`, `useWallHubCommentLifecycle`, ⌘K, `DraggableHypothesisCard`, `MissingEvidenceDigest`.
- `packages/charts/src/InvestigationWall/__tests__/WallCanvas.test.tsx` — add overlay-mode test cases.
- `packages/ui/src/components/Canvas/index.tsx` — add `onOpenWall` prop, wire `availableOverlays` derivation, mount `<CanvasWallOverlay/>` and `WallShortcutButton`.
- `packages/ui/src/components/Canvas/internal/CanvasOverlayPicker.tsx` — accept and respect `availableOverlays`.
- `apps/pwa/src/components/views/FrameView.tsx` and `apps/azure/src/components/editor/FrameView.tsx` — wire `onOpenWall` on the `<Canvas/>` mount, hoist `wallProps` so the same memoized assembly feeds the overlay layer here and the destination view in `InvestigationView` / `InvestigationWorkspace`.
- `packages/core/__tests__/layerBoundary.test.ts` — assert `'wall'` overlay is View-layer.

**New tests**:

- `packages/ui/src/components/Canvas/__tests__/CanvasWallOverlay.test.tsx` — covers Q1 (read-only), Q2 (empty state), Q4 (input layering), Q6 (mobile re-skin + cross-breakpoint resize).

### Test patterns

- `CanvasWallOverlay` component test: mount with mock `wallProps`, assert WallCanvas rendered with `mode='overlay'`; mount with empty content, assert null; mount with `useWallIsMobile()` mocked `true`, assert null; mount with `activeCanvasTool='draw-hypothesis'`, assert wrapper has `pointer-events: none`.
- `WallCanvas.test.tsx` (existing file): new `describe('mode=overlay')` block — assert no `DndContext`, no SSE subscription started, `HypothesisCard` rendered (not `DraggableHypothesisCard`), `MissingEvidenceDigest` not in DOM.
- 8d-compat integration: with `'wall'` overlay on AND `activeCanvasTool='draw-hypothesis'`, simulate a pointer-down on a canvas step card; assert the 8d arrow-draw handler receives the event.
- Resize: mock `matchMedia` to switch breakpoints; assert overlay mounts/un-mounts and toolbar slot re-skins between toggle and shortcut button.
- Layer boundary: assert `STORE_LAYER` for `useSessionCanvasFilters` keys including the new `'wall'` overlay value remains View; no Annotation/Document leak.

## 10. Verification (acceptance criteria)

- [ ] `CanvasOverlayId` includes `'wall'`; `coerceCanvasOverlays(['wall'])` round-trips.
- [ ] On a hub with no hubs / questions / findings, the canvas toolbar contains no Wall toggle and no `WallShortcutButton`.
- [ ] On a hub with ≥1 hub, the desktop canvas toolbar contains a Wall toggle in `CanvasOverlayPicker`.
- [ ] Toggling the Wall overlay on at ≥768px mounts `<CanvasWallOverlay/>` rendering `WallCanvas` with `mode='overlay'`.
- [ ] Pan/zoom inside the overlay updates `useWallLayoutStore`; opening the Investigation tab → Wall sub-tab shows the same viewport.
- [ ] Click on a hub card inside the overlay navigates to Investigation tab → Wall sub-tab with the hub selected.
- [ ] No DnD context inside the overlay (drag attempts on hub cards do nothing); no comment SSE subscription started; no `MissingEvidenceDigest` HTML panel rendered.
- [ ] With overlay on AND `activeCanvasTool='draw-hypothesis'`, an arrow-draw gesture between two canvas step cards commits a `CausalLink` (Wall layer is pointer-transparent).
- [ ] After deactivating the draw tool, click on a hub card inside the overlay drills as before.
- [ ] On a hub with content but viewport <768px, the canvas toolbar contains a `WallShortcutButton` with external-link glyph; click navigates to Investigation tab → Wall sub-tab.
- [ ] Resize from desktop with overlay active to <768px un-mounts the overlay and re-skins the toolbar slot; resize back to ≥768px re-mounts the overlay.
- [ ] `layerBoundary.test.ts` passes with the new `'wall'` overlay assertion.
- [ ] No regressions in PR6's per-step badge overlays (the four pre-existing overlays render unchanged when `'wall'` is also active).
- [ ] No regressions in 8d's hypothesis-arrow drawing tool with overlay off, on, or active alongside.

| Cross-breakpoint resize edge case: overlay active, resize <768px, overlay un-mounts, but `useWallLayoutStore` still has overlay-set zoom/pan that the destination view's mobile MobileCardList ignores. | MobileCardList is the canonical mobile Wall view; it doesn't read zoom/pan because it's a vertical card stack. No-op concern; the viewport state survives but is irrelevant on mobile.                                                     |
| 8d compatibility: pointer-events-none on the Wall layer might miss an edge case where the gesture handler is conditionally mounted.                                                                     | The 8d gesture handler is only mounted when `activeCanvasTool === 'draw-hypothesis'`; the Wall layer's pointer-events depends on the same selector. Single source of truth. Test explicitly covers the combined-active case.               |

## 12. Spec relationships

This spec extends Spec 4 (canvas overlays + Wall sync) — the umbrella spec named in the master plan. Spec 4 has not yet been written as a single document; its content is currently distributed across:

- 8d's spec (`2026-05-07-canvas-hypothesis-arrow-drawing-design.md`) covers the hypothesis-arrow authoring side.
- This spec (8e) covers the Wall mirror overlay.
- Pre-PR8 read-side overlay projections (`useCanvasInvestigationOverlays` + `CanvasStepCard` badges) are documented in PR6's commits but not yet retro-specced.

A retroactive Spec 4 consolidation document is a Tier 3 retrospective followup; it does not block 8e implementation. When that consolidation lands, this spec's status moves from `active` to `delivered` with a pointer to the consolidated home.

### External design references

- Vision §5.4 (mode lenses + canvas overlays) and §5.6 (Wall dual-home) — the spec commitments this implements.
- 8d Spec 4 §6 (input layering precedent) — extended here with z-stack + pointer-events ordering.
- F4 spec (`2026-05-07-data-flow-foundation-f4-three-layer-state-design.md`) — three-layer state model that the layer-assignment table observes.
- Master plan ([`2026-05-07-canvas-pr8-vision-alignment-master.md`](../plans/2026-05-07-canvas-pr8-vision-alignment-master.md) §4 8e entry, §6 sequencing) — the workstream context.

## 13. Workflow rules referenced

- `feedback_honor_vision_commitments` — Fork 1 chosen verbatim, not hedged.
- `feedback_hidden_vs_disabled_cta` — empty-state hidden, not disabled.
- `feedback_check_shipped_patterns_first` — input-layer order extends 8d's precedent.
- `feedback_world_class_critique` — mobile fallback grounded in industry pattern, not neutral options.
- `feedback_one_worktree_per_agent` — implementation will run in `.worktrees/canvas-pr8-8e/` per the master plan's parallel-writer discipline.
- `feedback_subagent_driven_default` — implementation will run as subagent-driven with per-task spec + quality reviewers.

## 14. Out of scope (carry-forwards)

- Write affordances inside the overlay (DnD hub→gate, hypothesis card reorder, ⌘K palette, hub-comment SSE).
- Multi-hub Wall tile / multi-context overlays.
- Overlay mount/unmount animation polish.
- Retroactive Spec 4 consolidation document (Tier 3 retrospective followup).
- Methodology integration for Wall vs Evidence Map vs Question framework (separate doc tracked in `docs/decision-log.md`).
