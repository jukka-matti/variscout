## Core Messaging Framework

| Element        | Message                                                            | Usage                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| **Tagline**    | "See Beyond Averages"                                              | Header, hero, social |
| **Hook**       | "Find what averages hide"                                          | Opening lines        |
| **Promise**    | "46% of your variation may be hiding in one place"                 | Journey, cases       |
| **Action**     | "Find it. Fix it. Check it. Continue."                             | CTAs, closings       |
| **Philosophy** | "VaRiScout finds WHERE to focus. Apply Lean thinking to find WHY." | About, positioning   |

## The "46%" Story

### Origin

The "46%" comes from a real pattern observed repeatedly:

- Averages look fine (90-95% pass rate)
- But one factor contains ~46% of all variation
- Fixing that one factor transforms the process

### Usage

```
"46% of your improvement potential may be hiding in one place."

"Where's YOUR 46%?"

"One factor. Nearly half the problem."
```

### Where It Appears

- Journey Page: Section 6 (CLARITY) - the reveal
- Case Study Insights: "The real impact was..."
- Homepage Hero: "Find your 46%"
- CTAs: "Where's YOUR 46%?"

## Framing: Opportunity, Not Problem

### The Shift

| ❌ Problem-Focused       | ✅ Opportunity-Focused             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| "52% of the problem"     | "46% of improvement potential"     |
| "Find the chaos"         | "Unlock the opportunity"           |
| "Averages lie"           | "Averages hide potential"          |
| "Your process is broken" | "Your process has hidden capacity" |
| "Fix what's wrong"       | "Find where to focus"              |

### Why This Matters

- Problem framing creates defensiveness
- Opportunity framing creates curiosity
- "What's hiding?" is more inviting than "What's wrong?"

### Example Rewrites

**Before**: "Your dashboard is lying to you."
**After**: "Your dashboard might be hiding opportunity."

**Before**: "Find the source of your problems."
**After**: "Find where your improvement potential lives."

**Before**: "Stop wasting time on the wrong issues."
**After**: "Focus your energy where it matters most."

## Voice & Tone

### Brand Personality

| Attribute      | Expression                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Practical**  | Tools that work at the gemba     |
| **Direct**     | Answer first, explain later      |
| **Confident**  | We know this works               |
| **Inclusive**  | Practitioners, not statisticians |
| **Empowering** | You can do this                  |

### Writing Style

| Do                    | Don't                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Use "you" and "your"  | Use "one" or "the user"        |
| Short sentences       | Long complex sentences         |
| Active voice          | Passive voice                  |
| Practitioner language | Academic jargon                |
| "See how X works"     | "X enables visualization of Y" |

### Example Copy

**Good**:

> "See how your data changes over time. Click any point to drill down."

**Not this**:

> "The temporal visualization capabilities enable users to identify patterns through interactive data exploration."
