## Why This Page Matters

This isn't a generic "About Us" page. It's VaRiScout's **origin story** - the narrative that differentiates us from every other stats tool. When someone asks "Why should I trust this tool?", this page answers.

## Who Reads This Page?

| Audience          | Question                                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Skeptics**      | "Why should I trust this unknown tool?" |
| **Quality nerds** | "What's the methodology behind this?"   |
| **Evaluators**    | "Who made this? Are they credible?"     |
| **Trainers**      | "Can I trust this for my courses?"      |

## Narrative Arc

### ACT 1: THE PROBLEM

**"Quality tools became statisticians' tools"**

- Minitab costs 2,000/year
- 90% of features unused by practitioners
- Green Belts afraid to touch the software
- The gap between "stats people" and "gemba people"

**Visual:** Screenshot of overwhelming Minitab interface

### ACT 2: THE LINEAGE

**"But it wasn't always this way"**

Timeline showing:

| Year  | Pioneer    | Contribution                             |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1924  | Shewhart   | Control charts - visual first            |
| 1950s | Deming     | "In God we trust, all others bring data" |
| 1977  | Tukey      | EDA - "The data must be looked at"       |
| 1980s | Shainin    | "Talk to the parts"                      |
| 1997  | Watson/ASQ | Six Sigma body of knowledge              |

**The insight:** Quality pioneers used VISUAL methods. Statistics came later, to confirm what they SAW.

**Visual:** Timeline graphic with photos/quotes

### ACT 3: THE WATSON CONNECTION

**"Learning from the source"**

- Dr. Gregory H. Watson - only Westerner with JUSE Deming Medal
- Designer of original ASQ Six Sigma training
- 450+ Black Belts, 50+ Master Black Belts trained in Finland
- BEST Lean Six Sigma methodology

> "I had the privilege of learning directly from someone who shaped how the world teaches Six Sigma."

### ACT 4: THE GEMBA LESSONS

**"Three experiences that shaped VaRiScout"**

**ESTIEM (European Students)**

- 1000+ students across Europe
- Insight: They need to SEE before they calculate
- "Show me the pattern first"

**ABB (Corporate Practitioners)**

- Real manufacturing data, real problems
- Insight: Tools must fit into workflow
- "I don't have time for a stats course"

**Africa (QC Circles)**

- Coffee processors, basic smartphones
- Insight: Simplicity is not optional
- "If it needs a laptop, it won't be used"

**Visual:** 3 cards with icons

---

### ACT 5: THE THESIS

**"Turning art into science"**

2019 Master's Thesis at LUT University:
"Mental Model for Exploratory Data Analysis Applications for Structured Problem-Solving"

The problem: EDA was described as "more art than science"
The solution: A structured 3-level mental model

```
Level 1: What's the Y? (Management data)
    │
    ▼
Level 2: Where in the process? (Flow analysis)
    │
    ▼
Level 3: Which factors? (Root cause)
```

**Visual:** Thesis cover + simplified model diagram

---

### ACT 6: THE TOOL

**"VaRiScout is all of this, in your browser"**

- EDA-first: See the pattern before the p-value
- Linked filtering: Click any chart, all charts respond
- Gemba-ready: Works offline, no install
- Accessible: 49/year, not 2,000

> "I built the tool I wish I had when I started training."

**Visual:** VaRiScout screenshot with "46%" highlight

**CTA:** [Try VaRiScout]

- **Personal** but not self-promotional
- **Humble** - "I learned from..."
- **Credible** - Watson connection, thesis, real experience
- **Clear** - Why this matters to YOU (the reader)

## SEO Considerations

Target keywords:

- "variscout story"
- "lean six sigma software"
- "EDA tools"
- "process improvement software"

Meta description:
"VaRiScout was born from 10+ years of training Green Belts, a Master's thesis on EDA, and learning from Dr. Gregory H. Watson. See why we built it."

---

## Mobile Considerations

- Timeline scrolls horizontally on mobile
- Cards stack vertically
- Photos scale appropriately
- CTA sticky at bottom
- Fast load (optimize images)
