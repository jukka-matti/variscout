# Week 2 Template: Gemba & Coaching

## Theme Core

**The contrast:** Theoretical/classroom vs. Built at the gemba

The credibility of a tool built from real experience - walking floors, doing analysis, coaching real projects.

## The Core Story

### The Gap

Most tools are built by developers who've never walked a production floor.
Most training happens in classrooms far from real processes.
Most "data analysis" happens in isolation.

### The Reality

VaRiScout was built from:

- Gemba walks
- Real coaching sessions
- Actual project tollgates
- Messy real-world data

## Video Structure (5-10 min)

### Opening Hook (30 sec)

- "I was standing on a production floor when..."
- Or: "The best insights don't come from the office"

### Story Context (2-3 min)

- [Month-specific gemba/coaching story]
- Specific moment that shaped the tool
- What you saw vs. what the data showed

### The Gemba Principle (2-3 min)

- Why being there matters
- How it changes the analysis
- What you learn that data alone can't tell you

### Demo: Coaching in Action (2-3 min)

- Show how VaRiScout enables live exploration
- The coaching conversation
- Exploring together vs. presenting at someone

### Close (30 sec)

- [Month-specific takeaway]
- The tool that survived real use

---

## Demo Moments (for screen recording)

1. **The "let's look at your data" moment**
   - Client brings data → upload → immediate exploration

2. **The "what about this?" coaching moment**
   - Client asks question → click → explore together

3. **The "aha" moment**
   - Pattern emerges through exploration

## Key Messages to Include

- [ ] Built from real experience, not theory
- [ ] Tested at the gemba, not just the lab
- [ ] Coaching is exploration together
- [ ] The tool survives real-world messiness
- [ ] [Month-specific learning/insight]

## Clip Ideas (30-60 sec each)

### Clip 1: The Philosophy

"Most stat tools are built in offices.
VaRiScout was built at the gemba."

### Clip 2: The Coaching Moment

"When I sit with a client, we don't present at each other.
We explore together.
[Click] 'What about this line?'
[Click] 'Interesting - let's filter to that.'"

### Clip 3: The Insight

"You can't understand process data without understanding the process.
[Month-specific gemba moment]"

### Clip 4: The Survival Test (optional)

"I've used this in training rooms, production floors, and coffee processing facilities.
It works everywhere because I built it everywhere."

## LinkedIn Post Angles

### Post 1: The Gemba Moment

"I was standing on a production floor in [location].

The team lead said: 'The data says we're fine, but something feels wrong.'

We pulled up VaRiScout. Uploaded the data right there.

Within 2 minutes: 'There. Night shift. See that pattern?'

That's what happens when you analyze data where the work happens.

[Month-specific context]"

### Post 2: Coaching Philosophy

"The best coaching sessions don't feel like presentations.

They feel like exploration.

'What about this?'
[Click]
'Interesting. Let's filter to that.'
[Click]
'There it is.'

That's what VaRiScout enables.

Built from hundreds of coaching conversations."

### Post 3: Built vs. Designed

"Some tools are designed in product meetings.

VaRiScout was built:

- At the gemba
- In coaching sessions
- During tollgate reviews
- With real messy data

That's why it works.

[Month-specific story]"
