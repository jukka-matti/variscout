## The Core Story

### The Problem

- Statistical software costs ~2k€ per year per seat
- Students lose access when training ends
- Companies ration licenses
- Developing economies simply can't afford it
- The result: tools become barriers, not enablers

### The Solution

- Browser-based
- Free (or very low cost)
- No installation
- No license management
- Just send a link

## Clip Ideas (30-60 sec each)

### Clip 1: The Reality

"Statistical software costs about 2,000 euros per year.
Per person.
Do you know how many companies ration licenses?
Do you know how many students lose access after the course?"

### Clip 2: The Moment

"[Month-specific moment when cost became a barrier]
That's when I realized: the tool was the obstacle."

### Clip 3: The Solution

"Now I just send a link.
No installation.
No license.
No IT ticket.
Just... start analyzing."

### Clip 4: The Perspective (M3 specific)

"2,000 euros is someone's annual salary in some countries.
We're gatekeeping quality improvement behind that price."

## LinkedIn Post Angles

### Post 1: The Numbers

"Statistical software: ~2,000€/year

Green Belt training: 5-10 people

That's 10-20k€ just for licenses.

Before anyone analyzes anything.

What if seeing variation didn't cost a fortune?"

### Post 2: The Moment

"The course ended.

Students lost access to the software.

Everything they learned... locked behind a license.

[Month-specific context]

That's why I built something different."

### Post 3: The Solution

"'How do I share this analysis with my team?'

Option A: Everyone needs a license.
Option B: Export to PDF. Static. Dead.
Option C: Just send a link.

I chose C.

Now everyone can see what's driving variation."

4. **The question:** Who can't afford to improve quality?
5. **The alternative:** Browser-based. Free. Just a link.
6. **The proof:** [Month-specific example]
7. **CTA:** variscout.com | @variationscouting
