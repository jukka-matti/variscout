# Week 4 Template: AI Comparison + Chart Teaching

## Theme Core

**The contrast:** AI/LLM analysis vs. Visual exploration (VaRiScout)

Each month features a different chart type, progressively teaching VaRiScout's core features while honestly comparing with AI tools like Copilot.

## Chart Progression

| Month            | Chart         | Teaching Focus      | AI Question                            |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **M1 (ESTIEM)**  | I-Chart       | Variation over time | "Can AI check process stability?"      |
| **M2 (ABB)**     | Boxplot       | Comparing groups    | "Can AI compare groups?"               |
| **M3 (Africa)**  | Pareto        | Prioritization      | "Can AI prioritize without cloud?"     |
| **M4 (Current)** | Full Workflow | Linked filtering    | "When to use AI vs. explore yourself?" |

## The Core Contrast

### AI/LLM Approach

"Let me analyze this FOR you"

- Upload data → Ask question → Get answer
- Black box reasoning
- May vary between runs
- Cloud-based (data leaves your machine)
- Linear Q&A conversation

### VaRiScout Approach

"Let me help you SEE and EXPLORE"

- Upload data → See immediately → Click to explore
- Transparent (you see the charts)
- Deterministic (same data = same view)
- Browser-based (data stays local)
- Non-linear exploration

### The Key Question

> "Do you want AI to TELL you what's happening, or do you want to SEE it yourself?"

Both have their place - but for process improvement, understanding matters.

## Demo: Copilot vs VaRiScout

### The Test Protocol

1. **Same dataset** (use consistent example data)
2. **Same question** ("Is this process stable?" / "Are these groups different?" / etc.)
3. **Show both approaches** side by side or sequentially
4. **Honest comparison** - not a hit piece on AI

### Comparison Points

| Aspect              | AI/Copilot           | VaRiScout          |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Reproducibility     | May vary             | Same every time    |
| Transparency        | "Here's my analysis" | You see the data   |
| Learning value      | Does it for you      | Teaches you to see |
| Data privacy        | Cloud                | Local/browser      |
| Follow-up questions | New prompt, new wait | Click, instant     |
| Audit trail         | Conversation         | Charts + stats     |

## Month-Specific Content

### M1: I-Chart (Stability Over Time)

**Teaching:**

- What an I-Chart shows (individual values over time)
- Control limits (UCL, LCL)
- Stability vs. instability
- Western Electric rules (briefly)

**AI Test:**

- Prompt: "Is this process stable over time?"
- Show Copilot's response
- Show I-Chart in VaRiScout
- Compare: Which tells you more? Which helps you understand?

**Demo moments:**

- Point at pattern in I-Chart
- Click to filter to subset
- Show stability verdict

### M2: Boxplot (Comparing Groups)

**Teaching:**

- What a boxplot shows (median, quartiles, spread)
- Comparing multiple groups
- Spotting differences visually
- ANOVA connection (is there a significant difference?)

**AI Test:**

- Prompt: "Compare defect rates across these machines"
- Show Copilot's response
- Show Boxplot in VaRiScout
- Compare: Understanding vs. just getting an answer

**Demo moments:**

- Visual difference between boxes
- Click one box to filter
- Show "Different? YES" verdict

### M3: Pareto (Prioritization)

**Teaching:**

- What a Pareto chart shows (80/20 rule)
- Vital few vs. trivial many
- Prioritizing improvement efforts
- The cumulative line

**AI Test:**

- Prompt: "What should I focus on first?"
- Show Copilot's response
- Show Pareto in VaRiScout
- Compare: Can you act on AI's answer without seeing it?

**Demo moments:**

- The "vital few" visible immediately
- Click top category to drill down
- Show contributing factors

**Special note for M3:** Emphasize that Pareto works without sending data to cloud - important for Africa context (infrastructure, data privacy).

### M4: Full Workflow (Linked Filtering)

**Teaching:**

- The magic of linked filtering
- Click Boxplot → I-Chart filters → Pareto re-sorts
- The exploration workflow
- Finding root cause visually

**AI Test:**

- Prompt: "What's causing the variation in this process?"
- Show Copilot's conversation (multiple prompts)
- Show VaRiScout exploration (clicks, instant)
- Compare: Time to insight, depth of understanding

**Demo moments:**

- Full click-through exploration
- Multiple filters combined
- The "aha" moment when pattern emerges
- Copy to PPT at the end

**Honest assessment:**

- AI is good for: Quick answers, brainstorming, summarizing
- VaRiScout is good for: Understanding, exploring, learning, presenting
- Best practice: Maybe use both - AI for ideas, VaRiScout for verification

## Clip Ideas (30-60 sec each)

### Clip 1: The AI Test

"I asked Copilot: 'Is this process stable?'
Here's what it said...
Now watch what happens when you just look at the data."

### Clip 2: The Click

"[Month-specific chart] shows you the pattern.
But here's the magic - click that bar.
Everything filters.
Now you're exploring."

### Clip 3: The Honest Take

"AI can tell you there's a difference.
VaRiScout shows you the difference.
One gives answers. One builds understanding.
For process improvement, I want to understand."

### Clip 4: The Learning Angle

"If AI does the analysis for you, what did you learn?
If you see the pattern yourself, you'll see it next time too."

## LinkedIn Post Angles

### Post 1: The Test

"I gave Copilot a dataset and asked: '[Question]'

Here's what it said: [Screenshot]

Then I put the same data in VaRiScout.

Here's what I saw: [Screenshot]

Both answered the question.

Only one helped me understand."

### Post 2: The Philosophy

"AI: 'Let me analyze this for you.'
VaRiScout: 'Let me help you see.'

One gives answers.
One builds capability.

For quick facts, AI is great.
For process improvement, you need to understand.

[Month-specific context]"

### Post 3: The Honest Assessment

"Here's when I use AI for data:

- Quick questions about unfamiliar topics
- Brainstorming what to analyze
- Summarizing findings

Here's when I use VaRiScout:

- Understanding MY process
- Coaching others to see patterns
- Presenting to stakeholders
- Building real capability

Both have their place."

## Important Notes

### Tone

- **NOT a hit piece on AI** - honest, balanced assessment
- Acknowledge AI strengths
- Position VaRiScout for where visual exploration wins
- "Both have their place" is the mature message

### Learning Value

- Each Week 4 video should teach a chart type
- Audience should understand what they're looking at
- Build visual literacy, not just tool usage

### Reproducibility

- Use same (or similar) dataset across all 4 months
- Makes comparison fair and progression visible
- Audience can follow along
