# Week 1 Template: Practical Stats / Visual-First

## Theme Core

**The contrast:** Stats-first meeting vs. Visual-first meeting

The "two meetings" story - showing how the same data conversation goes completely differently when you start with visuals vs. start with p-values.

## Angle Progression

| Month            | Angle                                 | Focus              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **M1 (ESTIEM)**  | "See first, stats second"             | The methodology    |
| **M2 (ABB)**     | "Statistics that start conversations" | The outcome        |
| **M3 (Africa)**  | "From p-values to patterns"           | The transformation |
| **M4 (Current)** | "Make your data visible"              | The action/CTA     |

## The Core Story: Two Meetings

### Stats-First Meeting

```
Analyst: "The p-value is 0.023 indicating statistical
         significance at alpha 0.05, so we reject H₀"
Manager: [nods, pretending to understand]
Manager: "What about third shift?"
Analyst: "I'd have to go back and check"

→ Manager can't engage, can't ask questions
```

### Visual-First Meeting

```
Analyst: [shows VaRiScout on screen]
Analyst: "Night shift has more variation — see the wider box?"
Manager: "What about third shift specifically?"
Analyst: [clicks Third Shift]
         Charts update instantly.
Manager: "Ah — it's just Machine 2 causing this?"
Analyst: "Exactly. Machine 2 on third shift."
Manager: "Let's check the maintenance log."

→ Manager engages, asks questions, makes decisions
```

## Video Structure (5-10 min)

### Opening Hook (30 sec)

- The problem: Stats-first kills engagement
- The question: What if we started with visuals?

### Story Context (1-2 min)

- [Month-specific story: ESTIEM/ABB/Africa/Current]
- How this experience shaped my thinking

### The Two Meetings Demo (3-4 min)

- Show stats-first approach (traditional)
- Show visual-first approach (VaRiScout)
- The difference in engagement

### Key Insight (1-2 min)

- Why visual-first works
- Connection to Tukey/EDA philosophy
- Stats support the exploration, not replace it

### Close (30 sec)

- [Month-specific takeaway]
- Soft CTA

## Demo Moments (for screen recording)

1. **The "click and filter" moment**
   - Manager asks question → click → instant answer

2. **The "plain language" moment**
   - "Different? YES" vs "p < 0.05"

3. **The "everyone can see" moment**
   - Charts visible, discussion natural

## Key Messages to Include

- [ ] Traditional Six Sigma: "Which test should I run?"
- [ ] VaRiScout approach: "What's driving variation?"
- [ ] Stats are available - when you need them
- [ ] EDA first, confirmation second
- [ ] [Month-specific learning/insight]

## Clip Ideas (30-60 sec each)

### Clip 1: The Problem

"Here's what happens when you start with p-values..."
[Show stats-first meeting scenario]

### Clip 2: The Solution

"What if you just... showed them?"
[Show visual-first meeting scenario]

### Clip 3: The Click

"Watch what happens when the manager asks a question"
[Click → filter → instant answer]

### Clip 4: The Philosophy (optional)

"Tukey said 'exploratory data analysis is detective work'..."
[Quick insight]

## LinkedIn Post Angles

### Post 1: The Problem

"I watched a Green Belt present to their manager yesterday.

They started with 'The p-value is 0.023, so we reject the null hypothesis.'

The manager nodded politely.

Then asked: 'What about third shift?'

'I'll have to check and get back to you.'

The meeting ended there.

What if they'd started with a picture instead?"

### Post 2: The Insight

"Traditional Six Sigma asks: 'Which test should I run?'

What if we asked: 'What's driving variation?'

One follows procedures.
One builds understanding.

[Month-specific context]"

### Post 3: The Philosophy

"John Tukey invented the box plot in 1977.

He also said: 'Exploratory data analysis is detective work.'

The ASQ Green Belt exam still tests stem-and-leaf plots.

Maybe we kept the wrong part of his legacy."

## Carousel Concept (5-7 slides)

1. **Hook:** "Two analysts. Same data. Different results."
2. **Analyst A:** "The p-value is 0.023..." [Manager confused]
3. **Analyst B:** "See this box? That's the problem." [Manager engaged]
4. **The difference:** Visual → conversation → decision
5. **The philosophy:** EDA first, stats to confirm
6. **The question:** Which analyst are you?
