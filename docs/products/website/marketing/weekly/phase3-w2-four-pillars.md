### Post 1: The Gemba Moment (Monday)

```
I was standing in a coffee processing facility in Africa.

The data I'd been staring at for hours suddenly made sense.

"See that pile of beans waiting? That's your 'holding time' column."
"See how this batch goes faster? That's why Tuesday's numbers look different."
"See that variation in the drying beds? That's your moisture spread."

The spreadsheet became real.
The data became physical.
The patterns had causes I could point at.

That's what the gemba teaches.

You can't truly understand process data without understanding the process.

### Post 2: Universal Principle (Wednesday)

```
I've been to gemba in:
- Coffee processing facilities in Africa
- Manufacturing plants in Europe
- Production floors around the world

Different industries.
Different cultures.
Different scales.

Same principle:

"Go and see" works everywhere.

The data makes sense when you've seen the process.
The variation has causes you can point at.
The improvement opportunities become obvious.

Different gembas, same truth.

### Post 3: The Insight (Friday)

```
What the African gemba taught me:

The data is not the process.
The data is a shadow of the process.

To understand the shadow, you must see what casts it.

That's why the best analysis happens at the gemba.
That's why VaRiScout works on any device.
That's why exploration should happen where work happens.

Take the tool to the floor.
Connect the chart to reality.
See the process, see the data differently.
