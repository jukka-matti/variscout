### Post 1: The Gap (Monday)

```
Most statistical software is designed in product meetings.

By developers who've never walked a production floor.

Features get added because they look good on comparison charts.

Not because someone needed them at 6am on the shop floor.

---

When I started teaching for ESTIEM, I realized:

The tools we taught didn't match the reality students faced.

Complicated menus. Heavy installations. Laptop-only.

Meanwhile, the best insights happened standing next to the process.

That's why VaRiScout was built at the gemba, not in the boardroom.

Where were your favorite tools built?

### Post 2: The Moment (Wednesday)

```
I was standing with an ESTIEM student at a production line.

She'd been struggling with her data analysis for weeks.

Charts weren't making sense. Stats were confusing.

Then she watched the process run.

"Oh. THAT'S why the variation happens there."

The data suddenly made sense.

---

You can't truly understand process data without understanding the process.

The gemba teaches what spreadsheets can't.

That's why I built VaRiScout to work at the gemba.

Take it to the floor. See the process. Explore the data. Together.

### Post 3: The Design Principle (Friday)

```
Design principle for VaRiScout:

"Would this work standing on a production floor?"

If no → Don't build it.

That means:
- Works on tablet/phone (not just desktop)
- Fast enough for live questions
- Simple enough for anyone watching
- No installation, no license key, no IT ticket

Built AT the gemba. FOR the gemba.

That's why it survives real use.

   - Designed for demos vs. designed for use
   - Features vs. function

5. **What "gemba-built" means:**
   - Works on any device
   - Fast enough for live questions
   - Simple enough for everyone

6. **The ESTIEM lesson:**
