## Video: "Statistics That Start Conversations"

### Duration

5-8 minutes

### Talking Points

**Opening Hook (30 sec)**

- "In corporate meetings, statistics usually END conversations..."
- "What if they could START them?"

**The ABB Context (2 min)**

- Working with engineers in corporate environment
- The reality of project reviews and tollgates
- Experienced people, complex processes
- The traditional dynamic: analyst presents, others nod

**The Pattern I Saw (2 min)**

- Stats-heavy presentations → silence
- "Any questions?" → none (because no one understood)
- Decisions delayed → "Let's review this offline"
- The real conversations happened AFTER the meeting

**The Shift (2-3 min)**

- What happens when you START with visuals
- Engineers see pattern → ask questions
- Questions drive exploration → click, filter, answer
- Discussion happens IN the meeting
- Decisions get made

**Demo: The Conversation (2 min)**

- Show a visual that invites questions
- "What about Line B?" → click → "There's your answer"
- The live exploration that creates dialogue

**Close (30 sec)**

- "Statistics don't have to end conversations"
- "They can start them"
- CTA

### Demo Moments to Record

1. [ ] A boxplot or chart that shows an obvious question
2. [ ] Someone asks "What about X?" → click → answer
3. [ ] Follow-up question → another click → deeper insight
4. [ ] The "aha" moment when pattern becomes clear

### Post 1: The Problem (Monday)

```
In most corporate meetings, statistics END conversations.

"The p-value indicates significance at the 0.05 level."

Silence.

"Any questions?"

None. (Because no one wants to admit they didn't follow.)

"Let's review this offline."

The real conversation happens later. Without the data.

---

At ABB, I watched this pattern repeat in project reviews.

Smart engineers. Good analysis. Dead meetings.

Until we flipped the approach.

What if statistics STARTED conversations instead?

#CorporateCulture #DataDriven #ProcessImprovement
```

### Post 2: The Shift (Wednesday)

```
Same meeting. Different approach.

Instead of: "The ANOVA shows significant differences..."

Try: "See these two boxes? Line B is clearly different."

What happens next:

"What about third shift on Line B?"
[Click]
"Interesting. What about last month?"
[Click]
"There's the pattern. Let's check the maintenance log."

Decision made. In the room. With the data.

That's what happens when visuals invite questions.

Statistics don't have to be a monologue.
They can be a conversation.

#LeanSixSigma #DataVisualization #MeetingCulture
```

### Post 3: The Lesson (Friday)

```
The best project reviews I saw at ABB had one thing in common:

The analyst didn't present AT the room.
They explored WITH the room.

"Here's what the data shows."
"What do you want to look at?"
[Click, explore, discover together]

The questions came naturally.
The insights emerged collaboratively.
The decisions got made.

That's what VaRiScout enables.

Not presentation software.
Exploration software.

Statistics that start conversations, not end them.
