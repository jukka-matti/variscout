# Phase 1, Week 3: "Drill-Down with Boxplots"

**Phase:** 1 (Launch)
**Week:** 3
**Type:** Teaching Video (Type B)
**Focus:** Interactive exploration - click to filter, linked charts

---

## Context

Week 3 is a teaching video showing VaRiScout's key differentiator: drill-down exploration. When you click a boxplot, all charts update. This is the "linked filtering" that makes EDA powerful.

## Video: "Drill-Down with Boxplots"

### Duration

2-3 minutes (quick win, practical skill)

### Core Message

"Click any boxplot. Watch everything update. That's how you find what's driving variation."

### Talking Points

**Opening Hook (15 sec)**

- "You've got data from three suppliers."
- "One of them is causing problems."
- "Which one? Let me show you a trick."

**The Static Problem (30 sec)**

- Traditional tools: make a chart, look at it, make another chart
- No connection between views
- You're manually filtering and re-plotting
- Slow, tedious, easy to miss patterns

**The Drill-Down Demo (1-1.5 min)**

- Load sample data with multiple factors
- Show boxplot by Supplier (A, B, C)
- "Supplier B has more spread. But is it consistently bad?"
- CLICK on Supplier B
- All charts instantly filter to just Supplier B
- I-Chart shows the time pattern
- Pareto shows the defect breakdown
- "Now I can see it's not just more variation - it's a specific pattern"

**The Insight (30 sec)**

- "That took 3 seconds"
- "In traditional tools: filter data, re-plot, filter again..."
- "Here: click and explore"
- "That's how you find what's hiding in your data"

**Close (15 sec)**

- "Try it yourself"
- "Link in bio / variscout.com"
- "See what's driving variation"

### Demo Flow (Screen Recording)

1. [ ] Load "Supplier Comparison" sample data
2. [ ] Show Boxplot by Supplier
3. [ ] Point out Supplier B has wider spread
4. [ ] CLICK Supplier B - highlight the interaction
5. [ ] Show I-Chart updating to just Supplier B
6. [ ] Show Pareto updating to just Supplier B
7. [ ] Click "Reset" to show returning to full view
8. [ ] Quick: click another supplier to show it works for any selection

## Clips to Cut

### Clip 1: "The Click" (30 sec)

- Show the boxplot
- The click
- All charts updating
- "That's drill-down"

### Clip 2: "3 Seconds vs 3 Minutes" (30 sec)

- In traditional tools: filter, re-plot, filter again
- In VaRiScout: click
- "3 seconds vs 3 minutes"

### Clip 3: "Which Supplier?" (45 sec)

- The question: which supplier is the problem?
- Click, filter, see the pattern
- The answer in seconds

### Title

"Drill-Down with Boxplots: Find What's Driving Variation in Seconds"

### URL

/blog/boxplot-drill-down

### Outline

1. **The Question Everyone Asks**
   - "Which [supplier/shift/machine] is causing the problem?"
   - The traditional approach: filter, re-plot, repeat
   - The time it takes

2. **What is Drill-Down?**
   - Click any element in a chart
   - All linked charts filter to that selection
   - See the same subset across all views
   - Reset to return to full data

3. **Demo: The Supplier Problem**
   - Three suppliers, quality complaints
   - Boxplot shows Supplier B has more spread
   - Click → I-Chart shows time pattern
   - Click → Pareto shows defect types
   - The full picture in seconds

4. **Why This Matters**
   - EDA is about exploration, not just plotting
   - Linked views reveal relationships
   - Speed enables better questions

5. **Try It Yourself**
   - Embedded PWA with sample data
   - Interactive: click the boxplots

6. **CTA**
   - Try VaRiScout: variscout.com/app
   - Learn more about boxplots: /tools/boxplot

### SEO Keywords

- boxplot drill down
- interactive boxplot
- linked chart filtering
- EDA exploration
- find variation source

### Post 1: The Demo (Monday)

```
I need to find which supplier is causing quality problems.

Traditional approach:
1. Filter data to Supplier A
2. Make a chart
3. Filter to Supplier B
4. Make another chart
5. Filter to Supplier C
6. Compare mentally

VaRiScout approach:
1. Make a boxplot by supplier
2. Click Supplier B
3. All charts update instantly

3 seconds vs 3 minutes.

That's drill-down. That's how EDA should work.

```

### Post 2: The Insight (Wednesday)

```
The boxplot told me Supplier B had more variation.

But it didn't tell me WHY.

So I clicked on Supplier B.

The I-Chart showed: variation spikes every Monday.
The Pareto showed: 80% is one defect type.

The boxplot was the doorway.
The drill-down was the exploration.

That's the difference between:
- Making charts
- Finding insights

What could you find if your charts talked to each other?

```

### Post 3: Try It (Friday)

```
Here's a quick trick that saves hours:

When you're comparing groups (suppliers, shifts, machines)...

Don't just look at the boxplot.

CLICK on the outlier group.

Watch every other chart update to just that subset.

Now you're not just seeing that there's a problem.
You're seeing what KIND of problem.

This is called drill-down.
It's standard in BI tools.
It should be standard in quality tools.
