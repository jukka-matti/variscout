# M1-W1: ESTIEM + "See First, Stats Second"

**Month:** 1 (ESTIEM)  
**Week:** 1  
**Theme:** Practical Stats / Visual-First  
**Angle:** "See first, stats second" - The methodology

---

## Context

This is the campaign opener. Introduce the core philosophy through the ESTIEM lens - developing GB curriculum with Gregory H. Watson, learning what students actually need.

---

## Video: "See First, Stats Second"

### Duration

5-8 minutes

### Talking Points

**Opening Hook (30 sec)**

- "I've watched hundreds of Green Belts present to their managers..."
- "Most start with the same mistake..."
- Tease the two meetings contrast

**ESTIEM Story (2 min)**

- Working with Gregory H. Watson on GB curriculum
- European engineering students from different backgrounds
- The challenge: teaching statistics to non-statisticians
- The realization: they struggle with stats anxiety, not intelligence

**The Two Meetings Demo (3-4 min)**

_Stats-First Meeting:_

- "The p-value is 0.023..."
- Manager nods, pretends to understand
- "What about third shift?" → "I'll have to check"
- Meeting ends with no decision

_Visual-First Meeting:_

- Show VaRiScout on screen
- "Night shift has more variation - see the wider box?"
- "What about third shift?" → Click → Instant answer
- Discussion happens, decision made

**Key Insight (1-2 min)**

- Tukey's philosophy: "Exploratory data analysis is detective work"
- Traditional Six Sigma inverted this - test selection before seeing
- EDA first, confirmation second
- Stats support the exploration, not replace it

**Close (30 sec)**

- "This is what ESTIEM students taught me..."
- "See first. Stats second."
- Soft CTA: link to VaRiScout

### Demo Moments to Record

1. [ ] The "p-value presentation" scenario (can be acted/described)
2. [ ] VaRiScout: Upload sample data
3. [ ] VaRiScout: Show boxplot with visible difference
4. [ ] VaRiScout: Click to filter - instant update
5. [ ] VaRiScout: Show "Different? YES" plain language

## Clips to Cut

### Clip 1: "The Stats-First Problem" (45 sec)

- The p-value scenario
- Manager confusion
- "What about X?" → "I'll check"
- Hook: "Sound familiar?"

### Clip 2: "The Visual-First Solution" (45 sec)

- VaRiScout demo
- Click → filter → answer
- Manager engages
- Hook: "What if you just showed them?"

### Clip 3: "The Tukey Quote" (30 sec)

- "Exploratory data analysis is detective work"
- Brief explanation
- Hook: "We kept the stem-and-leaf. We missed the philosophy."

### Clip 4: "See First, Stats Second" (30 sec)

- The principle stated clearly
- Quick visual example
- Hook: "Try this in your next meeting."

### Title

"See First, Stats Second: What ESTIEM Students Taught Me About Statistics"

### Outline

1. **The Problem: Stats-First Meetings**
   - The p-value presentation scenario
   - Why managers disengage
   - The questions that can't be answered

2. **The ESTIEM Context**
   - Developing GB curriculum with Gregory H. Watson
   - European engineering students
   - The stats anxiety problem

3. **The Realization**
   - Students don't lack intelligence, they lack visuals
   - Seeing patterns vs. calculating p-values
   - Tukey's philosophy

4. **The Alternative: Visual-First**
   - The same meeting, different approach
   - Show the data, invite questions
   - Click to answer, engage everyone

5. **Why This Works**
   - Visual is universal
   - Exploration builds understanding
   - Stats confirm what you see

6. **Try It Yourself**
   - Link to VaRiScout
   - Invitation to explore

### SEO Keywords

- Green Belt statistics
- Six Sigma data analysis
- Visual statistics
- EDA exploratory data analysis
- Process improvement statistics

### Post 1: The Problem (Monday)

```
I've watched hundreds of Green Belts present to their managers.

Most start with: "The p-value is 0.023, so we reject the null hypothesis at alpha 0.05."

The manager nods politely.

Then asks: "What about third shift?"

"I'll have to check and get back to you."

The meeting ends.

No decision made.
No questions answered.
No understanding built.

What if they'd started with a picture instead?

When I developed GB curriculum for ESTIEM with Gregory H. Watson, this was the pattern I kept seeing.

Smart students. Good analysis. Dead presentations.

The fix wasn't more statistics training.

It was learning to show before you tell.

See first. Stats second.

### Post 2: The Insight (Wednesday)

```
John Tukey invented the box plot in 1977.

He also wrote: "Exploratory data analysis is detective work."

The ASQ Green Belt Body of Knowledge still tests stem-and-leaf plots.

(When did you last make one by hand?)

We kept Tukey's technique.
We missed Tukey's philosophy.

He wanted us to LOOK at data before testing it.
To explore before confirming.
To see patterns before calculating p-values.

Traditional Six Sigma inverted this.

"Which test should I run?" comes before "What does this look like?"

What if we went back to what Tukey actually meant?

### Post 3: The Philosophy (Friday)

```
Two analysts. Same data. Different results.

Analyst A: "The p-value indicates statistical significance at..."
Manager: 😐

Analyst B: "See this box? That's the problem. Night shift."
Manager: "What about Machine 3 specifically?"
Analyst B: [clicks, data filters] "There - that's where it's coming from."
Manager: "Let's check the maintenance log."

Same data.
Different approach.
Different outcome.

One followed the statistics procedure.
One helped people see.

I learned this watching ESTIEM students present.
The smart ones figured out: show first, stats second.

That's why I built VaRiScout around this principle.

1. **Hook:** "Two analysts. Same data. Different results."

2. **Analyst A:**
   - "The p-value is 0.023..."
   - [Image: confused manager face / emoji]

3. **Analyst B:**
   - "See this box? That's the problem."

4. **The difference:**
   - Stats-first → Confusion
   - Visual-first → Conversation

5. **The philosophy:**
   - "See first. Stats second."
   - Tukey: "EDA is detective work"
