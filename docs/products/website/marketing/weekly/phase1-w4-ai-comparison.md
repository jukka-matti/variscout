# M1-W4: ESTIEM + AI Comparison (I-Chart)

**Month:** 1 (ESTIEM)  
**Week:** 4  
**Theme:** AI Comparison + Chart Teaching  
**Angle:** "I asked Copilot to check process stability..."  
**Chart Focus:** I-Chart (Individual Control Chart)

---

## Context

Week 4 of ESTIEM month. First AI comparison video. Teach the I-Chart while honestly comparing AI analysis vs. visual exploration. Set the tone for the series - balanced, not a hit piece.

---

## Video: "AI vs. I-Chart"

### Duration

8-12 minutes (longer due to teaching + comparison)

### Talking Points

**Opening Hook (30 sec)**

- "I asked Copilot to check if this process is stable..."
- Show the AI response briefly
- "Then I just looked at the data. Watch the difference."

**Teaching: What is an I-Chart? (3-4 min)**

- Individual values plotted over time
- Control limits (UCL, LCL) - voice of the process
- The center line (mean)
- What "in control" means vs. "out of control"
- Basic pattern recognition (trends, shifts, points outside limits)
- When to use it: continuous data, one measurement at a time

**The AI Test (3-4 min)**

_Setup:_

- Same dataset (process measurements over time)
- Question: "Is this process stable?"

_Copilot's response:_

- Show the actual response
- What it tells you
- What it doesn't tell you

_VaRiScout's I-Chart:_

- Upload data, show I-Chart
- What you can SEE immediately
- Click to explore (filter to time periods, etc.)
- The verdict: "Stable? YES/NO"

**The Comparison (2-3 min)**

| Aspect          | Copilot             | VaRiScout        |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Reproducibility | May vary            | Same every time  |
| Transparency    | Explains reasoning  | You see the data |
| Follow-up       | New prompt          | Click to explore |
| Learning        | AI analyzes for you | You learn to see |
| Audit trail     | Conversation        | Chart + stats    |

**The Honest Assessment (1-2 min)**

- AI is good for: Quick check, unfamiliar data, brainstorming
- Visual exploration is good for: Understanding, teaching, presenting
- For ESTIEM students: You need to LEARN to see patterns, not outsource it
- Both have their place

**Close (30 sec)**

- "AI can tell you the process is unstable..."
- "But can you see WHY? Can you explain it?"
- That's what the I-Chart teaches you
- CTA

### Demo Moments to Record

1. [ ] Copilot: paste data, ask "Is this process stable?"
2. [ ] Copilot: show response
3. [ ] VaRiScout: upload same data
4. [ ] VaRiScout: I-Chart appears with control limits
5. [ ] VaRiScout: point out pattern (trend, shift, or outliers)
6. [ ] VaRiScout: click to filter (e.g., "What about last month?")
7. [ ] VaRiScout: show stability verdict
8. [ ] Side-by-side or sequential comparison

## I-Chart Teaching Points

### What It Shows

- Individual measurements plotted in time order
- Center line = average (mean)
- Upper Control Limit (UCL) = mean + 3σ
- Lower Control Limit (LCL) = mean - 3σ

### What "Stable" Means

- Points randomly scattered around center line
- No trends, shifts, or patterns
- Points within control limits (mostly)
- The process is predictable

### What "Unstable" Means

- Points outside control limits
- Trends (consistently going up or down)
- Shifts (sudden change in level)
- Patterns (cyclical, etc.)
- Something changed - investigate!

### When to Use

- Continuous measurement data
- One measurement per time period
- Want to see variation over time
- Checking process stability before capability

### Plain Language

- "Is the process behaving consistently?"
- "Are there any unusual points?"
- "Did something change?"

## Clips to Cut

### Clip 1: "The AI Test" (45 sec)

- "I asked Copilot: Is this process stable?"
- Show response
- "Seems reasonable. But watch this..."
- Transition to VaRiScout

### Clip 2: "What is an I-Chart?" (60 sec)

- Quick visual explanation
- Control limits
- What stable vs. unstable looks like
- Hook: "This is what process stability looks like"

### Clip 3: "The Click Test" (45 sec)

- AI: Ask follow-up question → wait
- VaRiScout: Click → instant
- The speed of exploration
- Hook: "Which would you rather use in a meeting?"

### Clip 4: "The Learning Question" (30 sec)

- "If AI does the analysis, what did you learn?"
- "If you see the pattern yourself..."
- "You'll see it next time too"
- Hook: "That's the difference"

### Post 1: The Test (Monday)

```
I asked Copilot: "Is this process stable?"

It analyzed the data and gave me an answer.

Reasonable response. Good explanation.

Then I put the same data in VaRiScout.

The I-Chart loaded instantly.

I could SEE:
- The point that went out of control
- The slight upward trend in the last 20 samples
- The shift that happened around day 45

Copilot told me there was instability.
VaRiScout showed me WHERE and WHEN.

One gives answers.
One builds understanding.

### Post 2: Teaching the I-Chart (Wednesday)

```
The I-Chart is one of the most powerful tools in process improvement.

It answers one question: "Is this process stable?"

How it works:
→ Plot individual values over time
→ Calculate control limits (mean ± 3σ)
→ Look for patterns

What stable looks like:
✓ Random scatter around center line
✓ No trends or shifts
✓ Points within limits

What unstable looks like:
⚠️ Points outside limits
⚠️ Upward/downward trends
⚠️ Sudden shifts in level

Why it matters:
You can't improve an unstable process predictably.
First: get it stable.
Then: improve it.

This is week 1 of teaching VaRiScout's charts.
Next week: Boxplots.

```

### Post 3: The Honest Take (Friday)

```
"Should I use AI or traditional analysis?"

My honest answer: Both have their place.

Use AI when:
- Quick check on unfamiliar data
- Brainstorming what to analyze
- Summarizing findings for others

Use visual exploration when:
- You need to UNDERSTAND your process
- You're teaching/coaching others
- You need to present to stakeholders
- You'll analyze this type of data again

The key question for ESTIEM students:

"If AI does the analysis for you, what did you learn?"

The goal isn't getting answers.
The goal is building capability.

That's why I still teach the I-Chart by hand first.

## Case Reference

**Use the Bottleneck Case dataset:** `docs/cases/bottleneck/data.csv`

This dataset shows:

- 5 process steps with cycle times
- Step 2 has high variation (the real bottleneck)
- Step 3 has higher average but low variation (falsely blamed)
- Perfect for demonstrating how AI might calculate averages correctly but miss the variation story

**Connection to Week 1 Video:**

- Week 1 introduced the Bottleneck case
- Week 4 revisits with AI comparison
- "Remember the Bottleneck case? Let's see what AI makes of it..."

**Sample questions for AI:**

- "Which step has the longest cycle time?"
- "Which step should we focus on for improvement?"
- "Is this process stable?"

**Website reference:** /cases/bottleneck

---

## Alternative Sample Data

If not using Bottleneck case, use a dataset that shows:

- Mostly stable process
- One or two points outside limits
- A subtle trend or shift
- Something AI might miss or oversimplify

Suggested: ~50-100 data points, single continuous variable, time-ordered
