### Post 1: Real Data (Monday)

```
Training data is clean.

Real data is messy.

At ABB, I coached engineers with their actual process data:
- Missing values
- Outliers that made no sense
- Dates in three different formats
- That one column labeled "misc"

It was perfect.

Because it was THEIR data. From THEIR process.

They cared about the answers in a way no training exercise creates.

That's when real learning happens.

### Post 2: Side by Side (Wednesday)

```
The best coaching sessions at ABB didn't look like presentations.

They looked like two people at a computer, exploring together.

"What do you think is causing this?"
[Click, filter, explore]
"Interesting. What about if we look at it this way?"
[Click]
"There it is. I never saw that before."

That's coaching.

Not telling people the answer.
Helping them see it themselves.

VaRiScout was built for that moment.
Fast enough to explore live.
Simple enough to explain on the fly.

### Post 3: The Difference (Friday)

```
Two ways to coach with data:

Option A: "I analyzed your data. Here's what I found."
Result: They nod, take notes, forget.

Option B: "Let's look at your data together."
Result: They see, question, discover, remember.

The second way takes longer.
It also works.

That's why I built VaRiScout for exploration, not just presentation.

The best insights aren't delivered.
They're discovered.
