## Format: 3-Way Comparison

| Method                    | Description                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Copilot**               | Chat-based AI in Edge/Windows |
| **Copilot Analyst Agent** | Autonomous data analyst agent |
| **VaRiScout**             | Visual exploration tool       |

Same project dataset. Complete analysis. Three approaches.

## Video: "Complete GB Analysis - The Showdown"

### Duration

12-15 minutes (capstone of Month 5)

### Structure

**Opening Hook (30 sec)**

- "For 4 weeks, we tested individual tools"
- "Now: the complete Green Belt workflow"
- "Same dataset. Full analysis. Three approaches."

**The Project Dataset (1-2 min)**

- Realistic GB project data
- Outcome: Cycle Time (or similar)
- Factors: Machine, Shift, Operator, Day
- Include some spec limits for capability
- ~200 data points

**The GB Analysis Journey (1 min)**

1. Is the process stable? (I-Chart)
2. Is it normal? (Probability Plot)
3. Is it capable? (Cp/Cpk)
4. Which factors matter? (Boxplot + ANOVA)
5. What drives the most problems? (Pareto)
6. Are there relationships? (Regression, if applicable)

**Round 1: Copilot (3-4 min)**

- Conversational approach
- Step through each analysis with prompts
- Track: How many prompts needed?
- Track: How long does it take?
- Evaluate: Does it maintain context?
- Output: What do you end up with?

**Round 2: Copilot Analyst Agent (3-4 min)**

- Give it the dataset with minimal guidance
- "Analyze this process data"
- Watch what it does autonomously
- What does it think to check?
- What does it miss?
- How comprehensive is its analysis?

**Round 3: VaRiScout (3-4 min)**

- Upload data
- All charts appear (linked)
- Click-through exploration:
  - I-Chart: Stable? Any signals?
  - Toggle: Probability plot - Normal?
  - Toggle: Capability - Meeting specs?
  - Boxplot: Which factor differs?
  - Click that factor: Filter everything
  - Pareto: Where's the 80/20?
- Time it: How fast to insight?
- Copy to PPT: Presentation ready

**The Comparison (2 min)**

| Aspect                      | Copilot          | Analyst Agent    | VaRiScout   |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Time to complete analysis   | X min            | X min            | X min       |
| Prompts/interactions needed | Many             | Few              | Clicks      |
| Maintained context          | ?                | ?                | All linked  |
| Explored all angles         | Guided by you    | Its choice       | Visual cues |
| Presentation-ready output   | Needs formatting | Needs formatting | Copy to PPT |
| Learning/understanding      | It did it        | It did it        | You saw it  |

**The Verdict (1-2 min)**

- AI can do comprehensive analysis
- But: who did the learning?
- For GB training: The student needs the understanding
- VaRiScout: Every step is visible, clickable, explorable
- The capability stays with the person

**Month 5 Wrap-up (1 min)**

- Capability, Probability, Gage R&R, Regression, Full workflow
- Complete GB toolkit covered
- 3-way comparison throughout
- The theme: Tools that build YOUR capability

**Close (30 sec)**

- "AI can analyze. You need to understand."
- "VaRiScout helps you see, explore, and present."
- "That's the complete GB toolkit."
- CTA: Try it / Training inquiry

## The Workflow Demo (VaRiScout)

Show this as fluid exploration, not step-by-step tutorial:

```
UPLOAD DATA
    ↓
I-CHART appears
→ "Stable? Yes, but there's a shift around day 30..."
→ Click the shift period
    ↓
All charts filter to that period
    ↓
BOXPLOT
→ "Machine C stands out in this period"
→ Click Machine C
    ↓
Everything filters again
    ↓
PARETO
→ "Night shift dominates for Machine C"
    ↓
CAPABILITY (toggle)
→ "Cpk = 0.9 for this subset - not capable"
    ↓
PROBABILITY PLOT (toggle)
→ "Normal-ish, slight skew"
    ↓
INSIGHT: "Machine C on Night Shift after Day 30 is the problem"
    ↓
COPY TO PPT → Ready to present
```

### Post 1: The Showdown (Monday)

```
Complete Green Belt analysis.
One dataset.
Three approaches.

**The workflow:**
1. Is it stable? (I-Chart)
2. Is it normal? (Probability Plot)
3. Is it capable? (Cp/Cpk)
4. Which factors matter? (Boxplot)
5. What drives problems? (Pareto)

**Copilot**: Step-by-step prompting. Got there eventually. Many interactions.

**Analyst Agent**: Autonomous analysis. Comprehensive but generic. Missed some context.

**VaRiScout**: Upload → Click → Explore → Insight. Everything linked. 8 minutes.

All three found the answer.

Only one built my understanding.

### Post 2: The Real Question (Wednesday)

```
AI can analyze your data.

But here's the question:

Who learned?

When Copilot runs the analysis → Copilot learned
When Analyst Agent explores → The agent learned
When YOU click through VaRiScout → YOU learned

For Green Belt training, this matters.

The goal isn't to GET an analysis.
The goal is to BUILD capability.

Capability that stays with the person.
For the next project. And the next.

That's why I still train people to SEE patterns.

### Post 3: Month 5 Complete (Friday)

```
Month 5: Complete ✓

5 weeks of 3-way AI comparisons:

Week 1: Capability (Cp/Cpk) → Seeing if you meet spec
Week 2: Probability Plot → Is it normal? WHY not?
Week 3: Gage R&R → Can you trust your measurement?
Week 4: Regression → What's the relationship?
Week 5: Full workflow → Complete GB analysis

The theme throughout:

AI can calculate.
VaRiScout helps you understand.

Understanding builds capability.
Capability improves processes.

That's the complete GB toolkit.

## Sample Data for Demo

Create comprehensive GB project data:

- ~200 measurements
- Outcome: Continuous (Cycle Time, Weight, etc.)
- Factors: Machine (A/B/C), Shift (Day/Night), Operator (3-4), Date
- Spec limits: USL and LSL
- Design in:
  - A shift around day 30
  - Machine C performing worse
  - Night shift with more variation
- So the story emerges through exploration
