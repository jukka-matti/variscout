# M2-W3: ABB + "License Management Killed the Analysis"

**Month:** 2 (ABB)  
**Week:** 3 (Week 7 overall)  
**Theme:** Cost / Accessibility  
**Angle:** "License management killed the analysis" - Corporate reality

---

## Context

The cost angle from corporate perspective - not about affordability, but about friction. License management, IT tickets, waiting for access while the project stalls.

## Video: "License Management Killed the Analysis"

### Duration

5-8 minutes

### Talking Points

**Opening Hook (30 sec)**

- "The analysis was ready. The data was ready."
- "But the license wasn't."
- "So nothing happened."

**The Corporate License Reality (2-3 min)**

- Limited seats, shared licenses
- IT approval processes
- "Your license request is in the queue"
- The engineer who couldn't analyze their data
- The project that stalled waiting for software access

**The Hidden Costs (2 min)**

- Not just €2000/seat
- IT management overhead
- Training on license management instead of analysis
- Lost productivity waiting for access
- The analysis that never happened

**The Friction Tax (1-2 min)**

- Every barrier reduces usage
- Complex install → fewer users
- Limited licenses → rationed analysis
- The questions that don't get asked

**The Alternative (1-2 min)**

- No license to manage
- No IT ticket to submit
- Just a URL
- "Can you analyze this?" → "Already done"

**Close (30 sec)**

- "License management shouldn't kill analysis"
- "The best tool is the one you can actually use"
- CTA

## Clips to Cut

### Clip 1: "The Wait" (45 sec)

- Data ready, analysis designed
- "Your license request is in queue"
- Project stalls
- Hook: "How much analysis never happens?"

### Clip 2: "The Hidden Cost" (45 sec)

- Not just the license fee
- IT overhead, training, waiting
- The friction tax on productivity

### Clip 3: "The Alternative" (30 sec)

- No license, no IT, no wait
- Just a URL
- "Can you analyze this?" → "Done"

### Clip 4: "The Best Tool" (30 sec)

- "The best tool is the one you can use"
- Availability > features
- Access = analysis

### Post 1: The Story (Monday)

```
"Can you analyze this data?"

"Sure, let me just..."
- Check if I have a license
- Submit IT request
- Wait for approval
- Download installer
- Contact IT again for admin rights
- Attend mandatory training
- Finally open the software

"Actually, let's just use Excel."

At ABB, I watched this happen repeatedly.

The analysis died before it started.

Not because of skill.
Because of license management.

That's a problem worth solving.

### Post 2: The Hidden Cost (Wednesday)

```
The visible cost of statistical software: ~€2000/seat/year

The hidden costs:
- IT team managing licenses
- Training people on license management
- Waiting time while requests process
- The analysis that never happened
- The question that never got asked

The friction tax on improvement.

Every barrier reduces usage.
Every hoop reduces analysis.

What if the barrier was just... gone?

```

### Post 3: The Alternative (Friday)

```
"I need to analyze this data."

Option A (traditional):
License check → IT request → Approval wait → Install → Training → Finally analyze
Timeline: Days to weeks

Option B (VaRiScout):
Open browser → Paste URL → Upload data → Analyze
Timeline: 30 seconds

Same analysis capability.
Different friction.

The best tool is the one you can actually use.
