# M3-W3: Africa + "2k€ is Someone's Annual Salary"

**Month:** 3 (Africa)  
**Week:** 3 (Week 11 overall)  
**Theme:** Cost / Accessibility  
**Angle:** "2k€ is someone's annual salary here" - Economic perspective

---

## Context

The cost angle becomes visceral in African context. This isn't about corporate license management - it's about fundamental economic barriers. €2000 isn't inconvenient, it's impossible.

## Video: "The Real Cost Barrier"

### Duration

5-8 minutes

### Talking Points

**Opening Hook (30 sec)**

- "Statistical software costs about €2000 per year."
- "In some economies, that's someone's annual salary."
- "We're gatekeeping quality improvement behind that price."

**The Economic Reality (2-3 min)**

- What €2000 means in different economies
- Not inconvenient - impossible
- Quality improvement shouldn't be a luxury
- The organizations that need it most can't afford it

**What This Creates (2 min)**

- Two tiers of quality capability
- Developing economies excluded
- Excellence concentrated where wealth already is
- The gap widens

**The Design Constraint (1-2 min)**

- Africa became a design constraint for VaRiScout
- If it doesn't work there, it doesn't really work
- Browser-based (no expensive infrastructure)
- Free (no economic gatekeeping)
- Simple (works on limited hardware)

**The Opportunity (1-2 min)**

- Quality improvement for everyone
- Tools that work where they're needed most
- Capability without barriers
- Leveling the playing field

**Close (30 sec)**

- "Seeing variation shouldn't cost a fortune"
- "Excellence shouldn't require wealth"
- CTA

### Post 1: The Numbers (Monday)

```
Statistical software: ~€2,000 per year.

In some economies, that's:
- Someone's annual salary
- A small organization's entire training budget
- Simply impossible

We're gatekeeping quality improvement behind that price.

The organizations that need statistical thinking most - small manufacturers, agricultural processors, growing companies in developing economies - can't afford the tools.

So they don't improve.
Or they use Excel workarounds.
Or they give up.

Quality improvement shouldn't be a luxury good.

### Post 2: The Design Constraint (Wednesday)

```
Africa became a design constraint for VaRiScout.

Not as charity. As discipline.

If the tool requires:
- Expensive infrastructure → fails
- Annual license fees → fails
- Complex installation → fails
- Powerful hardware → fails

Because in resource-constrained environments, those aren't inconveniences.
They're impossibilities.

So VaRiScout is:
- Browser-based (any device)
- Free (no barrier)
- Simple (works everywhere)

If it works in Africa, it works anywhere.
That's not a limitation. That's good design.

### Post 3: The Opportunity (Friday)

```
What if quality improvement wasn't a function of wealth?

What if a coffee processor in Kenya had the same analytical capability as an engineer at Siemens?

What if statistical thinking wasn't gatekept by €2000 licenses?

That's the opportunity.

Not charity. Capability.

VaRiScout exists because seeing variation shouldn't cost a fortune.

Browser-based. Free. Works everywhere.

Excellence shouldn't require wealth.

## Case Reference

**Use the Coffee Moisture Case for examples:** `docs/cases/coffee-moisture-grr/`

This case provides concrete African context:

- East African coffee washing station
- Real economic constraints (moisture meters cost €500+)
- Quality champions working with limited resources
- Perfect example of "€2000 is someone's annual salary"

**Real example to reference:**

- Coffee processor in Kenya needs to verify moisture content for export
- Traditional tools: €2000 statistical software
- Alternative: VaRiScout in browser, free, works on any device

**Website reference:** /cases/coffee-moisture
