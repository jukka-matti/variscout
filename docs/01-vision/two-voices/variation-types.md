# Two Types of Variation, Two Types of Action

The I-Chart reveals patterns — but what you DO about them depends on what TYPE of variation you're seeing.

## Beneficial Special Causes

Not all special causes are problems. When the [characteristic type](../../03-features/analysis/characteristic-types.md) is directional (smaller-is-better or larger-is-better), a special cause that moves the process _toward_ the quality goal is a favorable signal:

- A cycle time (smaller-is-better) dropping below LCL = unexpectedly fast — replicate it
- A yield (larger-is-better) exceeding UCL = unexpectedly high — understand why

Traditional SPC treats all special causes as "investigate and remove." Direction awareness refines this: investigate favorable signals to _replicate_ them, and harmful signals to _fix_ them. This is the foundation for the green/red dot coloring on the I-Chart.

## The Critical Insight

**Looking at stability is the traditional use of control charts — but it's only half the story.**

| Situation                  | I-Chart Shows                                      | Action Required                               |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Special cause present**  | Points outside limits, patterns                    | Find and remove the cause (local action)      |
| **Stable but not capable** | All points within limits, BUT limits outside specs | Reduce common cause variation (system action) |

!!! warning "The Trap"
When a process is stable but not capable, local actions won't help. "Trying harder" or adjusting individual points just adds variation. The **system itself** must change.

## Who Does What?

| Role                            | Focus                | Type of Variation     | Typical Actions                       |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Operator**                    | Run the process      | Detect special causes | Flag abnormalities, follow procedures |
| **Supervisor**                  | Daily management     | Remove special causes | Investigate, correct, document        |
| **Quality Team**                | Monitor & measure    | Both                  | Track Cp/Cpk, report trends           |
| **OpEx / Business Improvement** | System improvement   | Common cause          | Projects, Kaizen, process redesign    |
| **Corporate Quality**           | Strategy & standards | Common cause          | Capability targets, investment cases  |
| **Management**                  | Resource allocation  | Common cause          | Approve changes, fund improvements    |

**Deming's insight:** Management is responsible for the system. If the system produces common cause variation that's too high, only management can authorize the changes needed to fix it.

## The Business Improvement Function's Role

When VariScout reveals a "stable but not capable" situation, this is where **Corporate Quality / Business Improvement / OpEx** comes in:

| They Ask                                          | VariScout Provides                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| "Which processes need fundamental improvement?"   | Capability analysis showing stable but not capable  |
| "Where should we invest in process redesign?"     | Prioritized list by gap between UCL/LCL and USL/LSL |
| "What's the potential ROI of improvement?"        | Variation % that could be reduced                   |
| "Which factors drive the common cause variation?" | Boxplot showing factor contribution                 |

**The workflow:**

```
LOCAL LEVEL                         SYSTEM LEVEL
─────────────────                   ─────────────────
I-Chart reveals                     I-Chart reveals
special cause                       stable but not capable
       ↓                                   ↓
Supervisor                          Corporate Quality /
investigates                        Business Improvement
       ↓                                   ↓
Find & remove                       Fundamental process
the cause                           change project
       ↓                                   ↓
Restore stability                   Reduce common cause
                                    variation
       ↓                                   ↓
BACK TO NORMAL                      NEW CAPABILITY LEVEL
```

## VariScout Connects Both Levels

**For local teams:** I-Chart with control limits → "Is something unusual happening?"

**For improvement functions:** I-Chart with BOTH limits → "Is the system capable?" + Boxplot → "What drives the variation?"

> VariScout finds WHERE to focus — whether it's a special cause for local action or common cause variation for system improvement. Apply Lean thinking to find WHY — and what to do about it.
