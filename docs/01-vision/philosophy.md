# EDA for Process Improvement

VariScout is **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for process improvement** — not statistical verification.

## Two Mindsets

| Academic Statistician            | Process Improvement Practitioner |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| "Is this significant at p<0.05?" | "Where should I focus?"          |
| Hypothesis testing               | Pattern finding                  |
| Prove with math                  | See with eyes                    |
| Statistical correctness          | Directional guidance             |
| Analysis as end goal             | Analysis as starting point       |

## The Goal

- **Find where to focus** — which factor, which machine, which shift?
- **See where to apply Lean thinking** — visual patterns reveal opportunities
- **Guide improvement effort** — prioritize by impact, not guesswork
- **Move fast, iterate, improve** — 30-second answers, not 30-minute reports

---

## The Key Insight

> VaRiScout finds WHERE to focus. Apply Lean thinking to find WHY — and what to do about it.

VariScout identifies **factors driving variation**, not "root causes." EDA shows _which_ factors explain variation — the _why_ requires further investigation (5 Whys, experimentation, Gemba walks).

This distinction matters: we quantify contribution, not causation.

## The Promise

> **46% of your variation may be hiding in one place. Find it. Fix it. Check it. Continue.**

This isn't a marketing claim — it's what the drill-down methodology routinely reveals. By applying filter chips to the highest-impact factors, practitioners typically isolate a significant portion of total variation to specific, actionable conditions.

## The Process Detective's Toolkit

VariScout's four core charts map to four detective questions:

| Tool                   | Detective Question                                                         |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **I-Chart (CHANGE)**   | "What changed between yesterday's shift and today's shift?"                |
| **Boxplot (FLOW)**     | "Retrace the footprints upstream. Where did this come from?"               |
| **Pareto (FAILURE)**   | "Where is the 'blood spatter'? The chaotic, mixed data?"                   |
| **Capability (VALUE)** | "Am I looking at a clue (customer issue) or just noise (irrelevant spec)?" |

**Add-on:**

| Tool                         | Detective Question                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Regression (CORRELATION)** | "Is there a connection between these two clues?" |

## The Guided Frustration Pedagogy

The Sock Mystery teaches through "guided frustration":

1. **Phase 1: Immersion in Chaos** — Let them fail so they ask why
2. **Phase 2: Physical Stratification** — Peel back layers with questions
3. **Phase 3: System Understanding** — Connect statistics to the real system

VariScout enables this same journey with real data:

1. Upload data → see chaotic I-Chart (frustration)
2. Click through factors → discover subgroups (stratification)
3. Drill down → find the actual variation source (understanding)

## Not What VariScout Does

VariScout is intentionally **not**:

- A hypothesis testing tool (use Minitab or R for that)
- A predictive modeling platform (use Python/ML tools)
- A DOE analysis system (use JMP or specialized software)
- A statistical verification engine (use academic tools)

VariScout is **the first step** — finding where to focus before investing in deeper analysis.
