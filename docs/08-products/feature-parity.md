| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| **Azure Standard** | Full analysis with CoScout AI, local file storage          | **PRIMARY** | Azure Marketplace | €79/month  |
| **Azure Team**     | + Collaboration, cloud storage, mobile, Knowledge Catalyst | **PRIMARY** | Azure Marketplace | €199/month |
| **PWA**            | Training & education                                       | Production  | Direct URL        | FREE       |

> Per [ADR-033](../07-decisions/adr-033-pricing-simplification.md), Azure App is the only paid product with a two-plan model: Standard (€79/month) and Team (€199/month). AI is included in all plans. Knowledge Catalyst is a Team feature. All are Azure Marketplace Managed Applications. PWA is free forever. See [ADR-059](../07-decisions/adr-059-web-first-deployment-architecture.md) for the web-first deployment architecture and [ADR-019](../07-decisions/adr-019-ai-integration.md) for AI integration design.
