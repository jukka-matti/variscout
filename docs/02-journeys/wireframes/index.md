# Named-View Wireframes

One doc per **named view** — the canonical visual identity of each user-facing surface. Views belong to the product, not to initiatives: design specs **link** here, never restate. Edit in place as views evolve (this is a `tier: living` directory; the decision-log carries what changed when).

**Why this exists** (owner insight, 2026-06-06): the pipeline went brainstorm → prose spec → plan → code, so the first time any UI visually existed was when code rendered it — interaction design was decided implicitly, and five framing-concept generations shipped coherently in code without ever being integrated visually. Wireframes are the missing artifact, not ceremony. See the process rules in the [first-session journey spec §11](../../superpowers/specs/2026-06-06-first-session-journey-design.md).

**Conventions:**

- One markdown doc per view, named for the view (`b0-landing.md`), with the interaction contract in prose + ASCII, and a richer HTML wireframe in `assets/` (self-contained; open in any browser).
- Journey flow docs and `traceability.md` reference views by name — the chain is **journey step → named view → L3 feature → component**.
- Reviewer pairs on user-facing tasks verify the built interaction against the view doc (not just the spec prose).
