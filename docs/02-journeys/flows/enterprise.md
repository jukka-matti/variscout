## Enterprise Page Requirements

The /product/enterprise page must answer:

### 1. Security & Compliance

- Where is data stored? → "Your Azure tenant, your data"
- SSO support? → Azure AD / Microsoft Entra ID
- Compliance? → SOC 2 considerations, GDPR
- Audit logs? → Azure native logging

### 2. Deployment

- How to deploy? → Azure Marketplace Managed Application
- Time to deploy? → Minutes (Managed Application)
- Who deploys? → Azure Marketplace handles it
- Updates? → Automatic via Azure

### 3. Pricing

- From €99/month (Standard), €199/month (Team), or €279/month (Team AI) — unlimited users in your tenant
- No per-user fees, no hidden costs
- Three plans: Standard (local analysis), Team (+ Teams, OneDrive, mobile), or Team AI (+ AI-enhanced CoScout, knowledge base)

### 4. Support

- Documentation-first
- Email support (support@rdmaic.com)
- "Your existing LSS/IT consultants can assist"

## Self-Serve Enterprise Model

Key principle: **No sales calls required**

| Step           | How It Works                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Discover       | Website, referral, content                                   |
| Evaluate       | PWA (free), documentation, case studies                      |
| Purchase       | Azure Marketplace (from €99/month, 3 plans, unlimited users) |
| Deploy         | Managed Application (automatic)                              |
| Support        | Documentation + email (support@rdmaic.com)                   |
| Implementation | Your existing consultants can help                           |

## Evaluator Erik (Secondary)

IT/Procurement evaluator may also be involved:

| Erik's Questions           | Answer                            |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Security architecture?     | Azure-native, your tenant         |
| Data residency?            | Your choice of Azure region       |
| Authentication?            | Azure AD SSO                      |
| Compliance certifications? | Azure compliance + our docs       |
| SLA?                       | Azure SLA                         |
| Exit strategy?             | Export all data, standard formats |

---

## Mobile Considerations

- Enterprise page should work on mobile (conference scanning)
- Key info visible without deep scrolling
- Easy path to schedule demo or download docs
- QR codes on printed materials

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric                         | Target |
| ------------------------------ | ------ |
| Homepage → Enterprise page     | Track  |
| Enterprise page → Deployment   | >5%    |
| Enterprise page → Contact      | >2%    |
| ARM template downloads         | Track  |
| Time to purchase (first visit) | Track  |

## After Purchase: In-App Journeys

Once Olivia's team deploys via Azure Marketplace, the journey continues in-app:

| Next Flow                                               | Who               | What happens                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Azure First Analysis](azure-first-analysis.md)         | Gary (end user)   | First login → SSO → empty state → first chart in < 3 min |
| [Azure Daily Use](azure-daily-use.md)                   | Gary (daily user) | Repeat analysis, Performance Mode, exports               |
| [Azure Team Collaboration](azure-team-collaboration.md) | Olivia (admin)    | Teams setup, sharing, onboarding colleagues              |

Users who tried the [PWA](return-visitor.md) before purchasing will find the same analysis workflow — skills transfer directly. The key differences are persistence (IndexedDB on Standard; + OneDrive sync on Team plan), file upload, Performance Mode, and 6-factor support.

## Gap: Enterprise Page Content Needed

**Status:** Content pending — the `/product/enterprise` website page does not yet exist. Journey flows currently route to this page, but visitors will land on a generic product page.

The enterprise page needs:

- Full security documentation (data residency, encryption, compliance)
- Deployment guide with screenshots
- Pricing calculator
- FAQ for IT/Procurement
- Customer logos / testimonials (when available)

Until this page is built, the [How It Works](../../08-products/azure/how-it-works.md) doc covers the technical architecture, and the [Marketplace Guide](../../08-products/azure/marketplace.md) covers deployment.
