# LSS Consultant Client Delivery

## The Problem

A freelance or boutique Lean Six Sigma consultant walks into a client meeting. The client has Excel spreadsheets full of production data but no analysis tools. Minitab demos require a license. The consultant needs to show value in the first 30 minutes — "Look what's hiding in your data" — to win the engagement.

After the project starts, the consultant needs to teach the client team to do their own analysis. Handing them a Minitab license ($1,695/year) or teaching them Excel formulas doesn't work. The client team needs something free, immediate, and self-explanatory that they'll actually use after the consultant leaves.

## The VariScout Journey

### The Client Meeting Demo

1. **Client shares Excel file** — "Here's our defect data from last quarter"
2. **Consultant opens PWA, pastes data** — 5 seconds, no login, no install
3. **I-Chart** — "See these spikes? Those aren't random — let me show you what's driving them."
4. **Boxplot by factor** — "46% of your variation comes from Machine 3. Did you know that?" Client's eyes widen.
5. **Drill-down** — "And it's specifically Machine 3 on night shift. That's where 46% of your defects are born."
6. **Pareto** — "80% of your defect cost comes from 2 of 8 defect categories."
7. **Capability** — "Your process has a Cpk of 0.7. That means you're inherently incapable of meeting spec consistently. No amount of inspection fixes this."

**Aha moment (client):** "You found that in 3 minutes? We've been looking at this data for months and never saw that Machine 3 on night shift was the problem."

### The Client Handoff

8. **Share PWA link** — "Here, bookmark this. Paste your data anytime. It's free forever."
9. **Teach Four Lenses** — "Every time you have data, ask these four questions: Change, Failure, Flow, Value."
10. **Recommend Azure App** — "When your team is ready for shared analysis and Performance Mode across all your machines, that's the next step."

| Stage                | Product              | Why                                                                                      |

| Client self-service  | **PWA** (free)       | Share link — client can analyze their own data anytime                                   |

### The Multiplier Effect

Consultants are force multipliers. Each consultant introduces VariScout to 5-15 client organizations per year. The free PWA removes the objection ("I can't afford Minitab for the whole team"), and the Azure App captures the upgrade when teams are ready. One satisfied consultant = dozens of potential Azure subscriptions.
