## The 3-Act Case Experience

Every case page follows this narrative arc:

### Act 1: The Setup

- Present the problem as management sees it
- Show the averages, the dashboard view
- "Line B is 3% under target"
- Create cognitive dissonance: "But wait..."

### Act 2: Your Turn

- Interactive demo with the case data
- User explores freely
- Some hints available if stuck
- "Can you find where the 46% is hiding?"

### Act 3: The Solution

- Scroll-based reveal of the analysis journey
- Step by step: I-Chart → Boxplot → Pareto → Drill-down
- The "aha moment": "46% was in Machine C, Shift 2, Operator X"
- Methodology connection: This is the Four Lenses in action
