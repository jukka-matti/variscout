# Case Study: "Do We Really Need a New Machine?"

## Background

Bright Star Foods is a food processing company in Nairobi. Their single packaging machine has been running for 6 years. The production manager has requested budget for a second machine, claiming: "We're at maximum capacity. We can't take more orders."

Before approving the €180,000 investment, the Quality Manager decides to collect some simple data. She assigns a production assistant to observe the machine for two weeks.

**Data collection method:** Record every stoppage - when it started, when it ended, and why.

**Shift:** 8 hours (480 minutes), Monday to Friday

**Reason codes used:**

- **Clearing output** - Moving finished packages to make space
- **No product** - Waiting for product to package (from upstream)
- **Refill supplies** - Loading boxes, film, labels, tape
- **Changeover** - Switching to different product/package size
- **Break / Lunch** - Scheduled breaks
- **Repair** - Fixing machine issues

## Week 1: Tally Sheet Approach

The first week, the observer used a simple tally sheet - making a mark each time the machine stopped, categorized by reason, plus recording total stoppage time at end of day.

### Daily Tally

| Day       | No product | Clearing | Refill | Changeover | Break  | Lunch | Repair | Total Stops |
| --------- | ---------- | -------- | ------ | ---------- | ------ | ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| Monday    | 4          | 3        | 2      | 2          | 2      | 1     | 0      | 14          |
| Tuesday   | 3          | 2        | 1      | 3          | 2      | 1     | 0      | 12          |
| Wednesday | 4          | 3        | 2      | 2          | 2      | 1     | 1      | 15          |
| Thursday  | 4          | 2        | 2      | 4          | 2      | 1     | 0      | 15          |
| Friday    | 5          | 3        | 2      | 4          | 2      | 1     | 0      | 17          |
| **Total** | **20**     | **13**   | **9**  | **15**     | **10** | **5** | **1**  | **73**      |

### Daily Running Time

| Day       | Total Stoppage (min) | Running Time (min) | Running % |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| Monday    | 218                  | 262                | 55%       |
| Tuesday   | 196                  | 284                | 59%       |
| Wednesday | 241                  | 239                | 50%       |
| Thursday  | 205                  | 275                | 57%       |
| Friday    | 258                  | 222                | 46%       |

**Week 1 Average: 53% running time**

### Week 1 Observations

The tally sheet immediately revealed:

- Machine stops **73 times per week** - about 15 times per day
- "No product" is the most frequent stop (20 times)
- Only 1 repair all week - the machine itself is reliable
- Friday had the most stops (17) and lowest running time (46%)

## Week 2: Detailed Stoppage Log

After seeing Week 1 results, the Quality Manager asked for more detail. Every individual stoppage was recorded.

## Data Summary for Analysis

### Reason Code Totals (Week 2)

| Reason          | Count  | Total Minutes | % of Stoppage Time |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------------ |
| No product      | 16     | 196           | 21%                |
| Clearing output | 10     | 160           | 17%                |
| Changeover      | 13     | 155           | 16%                |
| Lunch           | 5      | 150           | 16%                |
| Break           | 10     | 150           | 16%                |
| Refill supplies | 9      | 101           | 11%                |
| Repair          | 1      | 42            | 4%                 |
| **Total**       | **64** | **954**       | **100%**           |

### Key Observations to Discover

1. **Run Charts (Both Weeks):** Machine running only 53-60% of available time
2. **I-Chart (Week 2 stoppages):**
   - Most stoppages cluster 8-18 minutes
   - One outlier: 42-minute repair
   - Lunch (30 min) appears as consistent "high" points
3. **Pareto of Reasons:**
   - "No product" + "Clearing output" + "Refill supplies" = 48% of all stoppage time
   - These are _workflow issues_, not machine issues
4. **Planned vs. Unplanned:**
   - Breaks + Lunch = 300 minutes (31% of stoppages)
   - Workflow issues = 457 minutes (48%)
   - Only 4% was actual machine issue (repair)

### The Insight

The machine isn't at capacity. It's starving and choking.

- **Starving:** 196 minutes/week waiting for product from upstream
- **Choking:** 160 minutes/week waiting for space to put finished goods
- **Fumbling:** 101 minutes/week fetching supplies that could be staged

Fix the material flow and workspace layout → gain 7+ hours per week → that's almost a full extra day of production.

**No new machine needed.**

### The Solutions (No Cost)

1. **Staging area for finished goods** - Don't wait until output table is full
2. **Buffer stock from upstream** - Small WIP buffer before packaging
3. **Pre-staged supplies** - Labels, boxes, film ready at machine before shift
4. **Changeover preparation** - Next product's materials ready before current run ends

## Discussion Questions

1. Looking at the Week 1 run chart, what does the variation tell you?
2. On the I-chart, which points are "special causes" vs. common cause variation?
3. The Pareto shows the biggest losses. Which one would you attack first and why?
4. What would you recommend to management before any equipment purchase?
5. How could this simple data collection method be applied in other contexts?

## Teaching Notes

**Week 1 Charts (VaRiScout Lite):**

1. **I-Chart / Run chart:** Daily running % - 5 points showing instability (46-59%)
2. **Pareto:** Stop counts by reason - "No product" leads with 20 stops

**Week 2 Charts (VaRiScout Lite):**

1. **I-Chart (daily):** Daily running % - 5 points (51-68%), compare stability to Week 1
2. **I-Chart (stoppages):** Individual stoppage durations - 64 points, 42-min repair as outlier
3. **Pareto (counts):** Stop counts by reason - compare pattern to Week 1
4. **Pareto (minutes):** Stop reasons by total minutes - reveals true cost
5. **Boxplot by Day:** Duration vs Day - reveals Friday/Wednesday patterns
6. **Boxplot by Reason:** Duration vs Reason - shows Lunch/Repair as longer stops

**The Two-Week Teaching Progression:**

- Week 1: "How bad is it?" → Run chart shows 53% utilization, Pareto shows frequency
- Week 2: "Is it consistent? What's really costing us?" → Compare weeks, drill into individual stoppages

**Comparison Analysis:**
| What to Compare | Week 1 | Week 2 | Insight |
|-----------------|--------|--------|---------|
| Running % | 53% avg | 60% avg | Variation between weeks |
| Total stops | 73 | 64 | Fewer stops, but still too many |
| #1 reason (count) | No product (20) | No product (16) | Same culprit |
| Repairs | 1 | 1 | Machine is reliable |

**Key Insight:**
Week 1 Pareto (by count): "No product" leads
Week 2 Pareto (by minutes): "No product" still leads, but relative weights shift

Counting stops ≠ measuring impact. A 42-minute repair counts as "1" but hurts more than four 10-minute stops.

**Key learning points:**

- Simple observation reveals truth
- "Capacity problem" was actually a workflow problem
- No sensors, no software, no complexity needed
- One person, two weeks, pen and paper
- The solutions cost nothing - just better organization
- Count data vs. measurement data tell different stories
- Week-to-week variation shows this isn't a fluke
