# VariScout Lite: User Guide

This guide covers advanced features and workflows in VariScout Lite, focusing on interactive customization and specification management.

## Interactive Chart Customization

VariScout Lite allows you to customize chart labels and axis names directly on the dashboard without altering your original data source. This is called **Aliasing**.

### Renaming Axis Titles

You can rename the Y-axis (Outcome) and X-axis (Factor/Category) labels to make charts more presentation-ready.

1.  **Hover** over any axis label (e.g., "Weight" on the Y-axis). The cursor will change to a pointer.
2.  **Click** the label. A small popup editor will appear.
3.  **Type** the new name (e.g., "Net Weight (g)").
4.  **Click Save** (Check icon).
    - _Note: This creates an "alias". Your original data column name remains unchanged._

### Renaming Categories (Boxplot)

If your data has cryptic codes (e.g., "M1", "M2"), you can rename them to meaningful labels (e.g., "Machine 1", "Machine 2") directly on the Boxplot.

1.  **Click** the X-axis label of the Boxplot (e.g., "MachineID").
2.  The **Label & Category Editor** will open.
3.  You will see a list of all unique values found in that column.
4.  Enter a **Display Name** next to any value you wish to rename.
5.  **Click Save**. The chart will update immediately.

## Specification Management

Specifications (Spec Limits) define what is considered "acceptable" quality. VariScout Lite supports both standard limits and complex multi-tier grading.

### Setting Standard Limits (USL/LSL)

1.  In the **I-Chart header**, click the **"Specs"** dropdown button.
2.  A popover will appear with checkboxes and input fields for each limit.
3.  Enter your limits:
    - **USL (Upper Spec Limit)**: Maximum acceptable value.
    - **LSL (Lower Spec Limit)**: Minimum acceptable value.
    - **Target**: Ideal value (optional, drawn in green).
4.  Use the checkboxes to toggle visibility of each limit on the chart.
5.  Click **"Apply Changes"** to update the chart.
6.  **Result**:
    - Red dotted lines appear on charts (I-Chart & Boxplot).
    - Cp, Cpk, and Pass/Fail rates are instantly calculated in the Stats Panel.
    - Histogram updates to show spec boundaries.

### Multi-Tier Grading

For industries like Coffee or Textiles, simple Pass/Fail isn't enough. You can define multiple grades (e.g., Specialty, Premium, Commercial).

1.  In the **I-Chart header**, click the **"Specs"** dropdown.
2.  Click the **gear icon** in the popover to open the full **Spec Editor** modal.
3.  In the "Grades" section, click **"+ Add"**.
4.  Define a grade:
    - **Label**: e.g., "Grade A".
    - **Max**: The upper limit for this grade (inclusive).
    - **Color**: Pick a color for visualization.
5.  Add as many grades as needed. Ensure they are sorted logically (the editor usually handles sorting by max value).
6.  **Result**: Charts will show colored background bands corresponding to these grades.

## Visualization Options

You can toggle visibility of chart elements and change display settings in the **Settings Panel**.

1.  Click the **Settings icon (⚙)** in the top right of the header.
2.  The Settings Panel will slide in from the right.
3.  In the **"Display Options"** section, toggle:
    - **Lock Y-axis when drilling**: Keep the Y-axis scale consistent when filtering data.
    - **Show Control Limits**: Display UCL/Mean/LCL lines on the I-Chart (statistical process control limits based on 3-sigma rule).
4.  In the **"Y-Axis Scale Mode"** section, choose:
    - **Auto**: Automatically fit scale to data and specification limits.
    - **Start at Zero**: Force Y-axis minimum to zero (useful for ratio data).
    - **Manual**: Set explicit Min and Max values for the Y-axis.
5.  Spec limit visibility (USL/LSL/Target) is now controlled via the **Specs dropdown** in the I-Chart header.

## Data Import Formats

### Supported File Types

| Format | Extension | Notes                                 |
| ------ | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| CSV    | `.csv`    | Comma-separated, UTF-8 recommended    |
| Excel  | `.xlsx`   | First sheet only, first row = headers |

### CSV Requirements

```csv
Supplier,Shift,Weight
Farm A,Morning,325.5
Farm B,Afternoon,318.2
Farm A,Morning,330.1
```

- **First row**: Column headers (required)
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 preferred (for international characters)
- **Delimiter**: Comma (`,`)
- **Numeric columns**: Use period (`.`) for decimals

### Excel Requirements

- **Sheet**: Only the first sheet is read
- **Headers**: First row must contain column names
- **Data types**: Numeric columns should be formatted as numbers
- **Limit**: Maximum 50,000 rows

### Data Size Limits

| Threshold           | Behavior                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| < 5,000 rows        | Loads immediately                     |
| 5,000 - 50,000 rows | Warning prompt (may slow performance) |
| > 50,000 rows       | Rejected (file too large)             |

### Data Validation

When you upload a file, VariScout automatically validates your data and shows a summary:

**What Gets Validated:**

- The outcome column (Y) is checked for valid numeric values
- Rows with missing or non-numeric values are excluded from analysis

**Validation Summary Banner:**
After uploading, you'll see a banner showing:

- Total rows in the file
- Valid rows ready for analysis
- Excluded rows with reasons (if any)

**Viewing Excluded Rows:**

1. Click **"View Excluded Rows"** in the validation banner
2. The Data Table opens filtered to show only problem rows
3. Excluded rows are highlighted with an amber background
4. Hover over the warning icon to see the specific issue

**Common Issues:**
| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Missing values | Empty cells in outcome column | Fill in values or remove rows in source file |
| Non-numeric values | Text like "N/A" or "pending" | Replace with numbers or remove rows |

Validation is informational — your analysis proceeds with valid rows. You can inspect issues anytime via the Data Table.

### Pareto Data Source

By default, the Pareto chart counts occurrences from your selected factors. For some use cases, you may want to use pre-aggregated data instead.

**Default: Derived from Factors**

- Counts computed automatically from your data
- Updates when you apply filters
- Uses the selected factor for grouping

**Optional: Separate Pareto File**

If you have pre-aggregated counts (e.g., from ERP or MES systems):

1. In the column mapping screen, scroll to **"Pareto Source"**
2. Drop a CSV/Excel file with category + count columns
3. The chart will use this data instead

**Important:** Separate Pareto data is NOT linked to main data filters. When you filter your process data, the Pareto chart won't update if using a separate file.

### Auto-Detection

VariScout uses smart keyword-based detection to suggest column roles:

**Outcome (Y) Detection** — Numeric columns containing:

- Measurement terms: `weight`, `length`, `width`, `height`, `thickness`
- Time metrics: `time`, `duration`, `cycle`, `lead`, `ct`
- Process values: `temperature`, `pressure`, `yield`, `output`

**Factor (X) Detection** — Categorical columns containing:

- Process factors: `shift`, `operator`, `machine`, `line`, `station`
- Grouping terms: `product`, `batch`, `supplier`, `lot`, `team`

**Time Column Detection** — Columns containing:

- `date`, `time`, `timestamp`, `datetime`, `created`, `recorded`

The detection algorithm also:

- Analyzes multiple rows (not just the first) to determine column types
- Prioritizes keyword matches over simple type detection
- Limits factors to 3 columns maximum

You can always override these suggestions in the column mapping screen.

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

### Data Issues

**Q: My data isn't showing up after upload**

A: Check that:

1. Your file has a header row
2. At least one column contains numeric data
3. File size is under 50,000 rows

**Q: Numeric column is being treated as text**

A: Excel may format numbers as text. Re-format the column as "Number" in Excel and re-export.

**Q: Special characters (é, ü, etc.) look wrong**

A: Save your CSV as UTF-8 encoding. In Excel: Save As → CSV UTF-8.

### Charts

**Q: I-Chart control limits seem wrong**

A: Control limits (UCL/LCL) are calculated from your data using the 3-sigma rule:

- UCL = Mean + 3 × StdDev
- LCL = Mean − 3 × StdDev

They reflect what your process **is doing**, not what it **should do**. Specification limits (USL/LSL) are separate.

**Q: Charts are too small on my screen**

A: Enable **Large Mode** in Settings for 30% larger fonts and touch targets.

### Offline Use

**Q: Can I use VariScout without internet?**

A: Yes! After visiting once, the app caches itself for offline use. You can even "Add to Home Screen" for an app-like experience.

**Q: Where is my data stored?**

A: All data stays in your browser:

- **Explicit save**: Click **"Save"** in the toolbar to save your project to IndexedDB
- **Saved Projects**: Stored in IndexedDB (larger storage, persists across sessions)
- **Session start**: App always starts on HomeScreen - load saved projects from there
- **No cloud**: Nothing is sent to any server

### Projects & Export

**Q: How do I share my analysis?**

A: Click the **Share icon (↗)** in the header to see export options:

- **Export Image (PNG)**: Save charts as images for presentations
- **Export Data (CSV)**: Download the filtered data as a spreadsheet
- **Download Project (.vrs)**: Save the complete analysis for sharing

Others can import .vrs files by clicking the **Logo** and selecting **"Open Project"**.

**Q: Can I open .vrs files in Excel?**

A: Not directly. Use the **Share icon (↗)** and select **"Export Data (CSV)"** to export your data in a format Excel can open.
