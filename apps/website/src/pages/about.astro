					VaRiScout is built by <strong>RDMAIC Oy</strong>, a Finnish company on a mission to make quality analysis tools accessible to everyone.
				</p>
				<p class="text-neutral-600">
					We believe that understanding variation shouldn't require expensive software or a statistics degree. VaRiScout brings professional SPC analysis to quality practitioners, trainers, students, and teams — with tools that are simple enough for anyone and rigorous enough for experts.
				</p>
				<p class="text-neutral-600">
					Our approach: your data stays yours. VaRiScout runs entirely in your browser or your Azure tenant. We never see your data — that's by design.
