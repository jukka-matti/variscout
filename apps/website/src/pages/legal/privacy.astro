				<h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-neutral-900">Our Principle</h2>
				<p>
					VaRiScout is designed so that your data stays yours. We built the product to work without collecting your data — and that's by design, not by accident.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-neutral-900">Web App (PWA)</h2>
				<p>
					The VaRiScout Web App runs entirely in your browser. Your data is processed locally and never sent to any server. We do not collect, store, or have access to any data you analyze. Session data is cleared when you close the tab.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-neutral-900">Excel Add-in</h2>
				<p>
					The VaRiScout Excel Add-in processes data within your Excel environment. Your spreadsheet data stays in Excel and is not transmitted to external services.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-neutral-900">Azure App</h2>
				<p>
					The Azure App is deployed as a Managed Application in your own Azure tenant. Your data remains within your Azure subscription and is subject to your organization's Azure policies. RDMAIC Oy does not have access to your tenant data.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-neutral-900">Website Analytics</h2>
				<p>
					This marketing website may use basic analytics to understand visitor patterns. No personal data from the VaRiScout application is ever collected.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-neutral-900">Contact</h2>
				<p>
					For privacy questions, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@variscout.com" class="text-brand-primary hover:underline">hello@variscout.com</a>.
